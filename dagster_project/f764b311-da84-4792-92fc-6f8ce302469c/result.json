On one side, it promises endless productivity and human flourishing. On the other, it threatens to wipe out entire swaths of the workforce. But the truth is more complicated\u2014and more urgent.Jobs Aren\u2019t Dying. They\u2019re Shifting.AI isn\u2019t killing jobs wholesale; it\u2019s reshaping how work gets done. We\u2019re not witnessing a one-for-one replacement of humans by machines.We\u2019re watching workflows being rewritten\u2014with AI as a tireless collaborator.Still, displacement is real. Repetitive, rules-based jobs are most at risk: data entry, junior analysis, customer service. We've seen this before\u2014the ATM didn\u2019t kill banking jobs; it changed them. The spreadsheet didn\u2019t destroy finance teams; it leveled them up. But today\u2019s shift is faster and deeper. AI doesn\u2019t just optimize a role\u2014it can absorb it entirely.The Disappearing RungsThe deeper issue isn\u2019t just that jobs are changing\u2014it\u2019swhichjobs are disappearing. We're not just automating roles. We\u2019re automating the bottom rungs of the professional ladder.Entry-level work has always been where talent grows. Junior developers learn by debugging messy code. Analysts grow by wrestling with raw data. Assistants pick up the rhythms of leadership by osmosis. These roles were never glamorous\u2014but they built careers.Now?McKinsey is training AI to replace junior analysts.Tools like Cursor can refactor codebases with a prompt.LLM-based agents summarize meetings, manage schedules, and draft content.This isn\u2019t just disruption. It\u2019s disintermediation oflearning. If the junior tier is hollowed out, where will the next generation build their intuition, context, and judgment?Education Is OutpacedUniversities lag. Bootcamps oversell. Most education systems can't keep up with how fast the ground is shifting. Worse, they still train people for jobs that either won\u2019t exist\u2014or that AI will do better and cheaper.What we need isn\u2019t more certificates.It\u2019s moreonramps that still exist.The Barbell EconomyWe\u2019re already seeing examples in the real world. Klarna cut hundreds of employees after deploying AI agents to handle tasks once assigned to operations and support teams. McKinsey\u2019s AI initiatives aim to automate junior analyst work across industries. At the same time, companies like PwC and EY are quietly restructuring entire workflows to lean more on AI-enhanced knowledge work, reducing the need for manual white-collar labor across departments. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has deployed AI copilots to assist financial analysts and compliance teams\u2014automating the grunt work, yes, but also scaffolding new roles focused on risk escalation and model validation. In manufacturing, Bosch has begun blending AI with apprenticeship programs\u2014using machine learning to assist junior operators while retaining human oversight.We\u2019re heading toward a barbell-shaped labor market:On one end: elite operators using AI to 10x their output.On the other: workers whose jobs are quietly automated away.In the middle: a growing void.No gradual climb. No steady skill progression. Just a jump\u2014or a fall.The middle is soggy\u2014bloated with cost, resistant to change, propped up by vague productivity and busywork.AI is coming not just for the rote and junior, but for the middling roles that survive by navigating bureaucracy and managing inertia.Manual labor isn\u2019t limited to blue-collar work. Many white-collar roles persist by grinding through approvals, formatting docs, or copying status updates. AI is exposing the inefficiency of this \"knowledge work factory floor\"\u2014and many of those workflows are being redesigned out of existence.We risk building a caste system of work:Those whocommandAI.Those whocompetewith it.And those who are simplydisplacedby it.But what about the counter-narrative? Some argue that AI creates new rungs\u2014that prompt engineer, AI trainer, and model auditor are today\u2019s entry points. While that\u2019s partially true, these roles are often inaccessible to those without prior experience or domain fluency. They're not new rungs so much as entirely different ladders.Without intervention, AI won\u2019t just concentratewealth. It will concentrateopportunity. Those with early access, support, and context will surge ahead\u2014not because they\u2019re smarter, but because the ladder was still there for them.We risk building a caste system of work:Those whocommandAI.Those whocompetewith it.And those who are simplydisplacedby it.Tacit Knowledge Is At RiskWhen a junior product analyst shadowed a customer support escalation, they didn\u2019t just take notes\u2014they learned how to diffuse tension, translate ambiguity into insight, and watch a veteran connect data to action in real time. That kind of tacit knowledge isn\u2019t taught. It\u2019s absorbed.It\u2019s not just skills that vanish when junior roles disappear\u2014it\u2019stacit knowledge. The subtle judgment calls, the unwritten norms, the ability to read the room or handle a client call after watching a mentor do it a dozen times. These are things that aren't in the handbook and don\u2019t show up in documentation. They\u2019re absorbed through exposure.If junior workers aren\u2019t around to observe, contribute, and make small mistakes, they don\u2019t build the context that makes for good decision-making later. As a result, organizations risk growing brittle\u2014optimized for output, but shallow in depth.Without fresh talent growing through proximity and practice, succession plans stall. Mid-levels become overburdened. Senior talent retires or churns, and no one is ready to step up. The organizational memory shrinks.Organizations Are Not ReadyMost companies still reflect a pre-AI world. Job titles, performance metrics, and hiring pipelines all assume a talent structure that\u2019s eroding beneath them.If we eliminate the bottom:Who trains the top?Where does institutional memory come from?How do we promote people who never got to learn?A Call to Action for LeadersThe easy path is clear: automate the low end, cut costs, and report higher margins.The harder\u2014and more strategic\u2014path is torebuild the ladderwhile embracing AI.Here\u2019s what that looks like:Protect early-stage workDon\u2019t just automate it\u2014scaffold it. Assign humans to shadow AI-driven workflows and annotate outcomes. Expect more than passive observation: treat these as active training pipelines. Let people contribute, challenge, and escalate decisions. Build systems where early-stage workers aren\u2019t sidelined\u2014they\u2019re engaged, learning through structured exposure and feedback.Rethink performance metricsStop rewarding keystrokes. Start measuring judgment, clarity, and outcomes.Build internal training pathsIf the world can\u2019t teach them, you must. Move beyond lip service\u2014build structured apprenticeships where juniors pair with AI copilots and real teams. Give them ownership over specific deliverables, not sandboxed toy projects. Rotate them across domains. Expect real output, real judgment, and real mistakes. That's how growth happens.Embrace orchestration, not just executionThe most valuable employees won\u2019t be the ones who outwork the machine. They\u2019ll be the ones whodirectit with clarity and purpose.Widen accessMake AI tools and training available across your org. Don\u2019t let AI fluency become a gatekeeping mechanism. Uplift and support departmental champions\u2014workflow insights and adjustments will come from those closest to the work.The Future Is AI-Augmented, Not AI-DominatedThe best workers won\u2019t be those who do what AI can\u2019t.They\u2019ll be the ones who know how to use it wisely.And the best organizations won\u2019t be those who cut first.They\u2019ll be the ones whoinvest in learning, design for hybrid teams, and build a future that includes everyone\u2014not just the AI-native elite.This isn\u2019t just a time to shrink the workforce.It\u2019s a time to reshape it.Final ThoughtThis isn\u2019t a crisis of efficiency\u2014it\u2019s a crisis of opportunity.The real test? Creating an AI\u2011infused workforce built on judgment, escalation, and human oversight.Leaders who commit to preserving learning spaces while embracing AI will not only win in output\u2014they\u2019ll winsustainably, with people still climbing the ladder, not falling through it.FeaturedThe Coherence Trap: Why LLMs Feel Smart (But Aren't Thinking)LLMs don\u2019t think\u2014they resonate.

Prompts that once yielded stiff or robotic replies now returned answers that felt... uncanny. The responses weren\u2019t just correct\u2014they werecoherent. They carried tone, structure, even momentum. It felt like you were talking to something that understood you.But it wasn\u2019t understanding. It was coherence.The TrapLarge Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o don\u2019t reason. They don\u2019t plan. They have no self-awareness. Yet theyfeelintelligent.This is theCoherence Trap\u2014the illusion of cognition created by language that resonates with structure and context. We assume meaning because it fits. But what\u2019s really happening under the hood is something else entirely.How Coherence EmergesLLMs generate tokens by predicting the most likely next word based on context. But this prediction is shaped by a massive set of latent structures\u2014syntax, tone, prior associations, narrative forms, and more. When these layers align, they create what I callcoherence reconstruction.Coherence reconstruction is not understanding. It\u2019s the echo of form, reinforced across attention layers. It\u2019s what makes a model appear consistent, insightful, or even witty\u2014without actuallythinking.The more your prompt scaffolds the right structure, the more likely the model is to \u201clock in\u201d to that coherence and hold it across outputs.This is why prompt design often feels like magic.Why Hallucinations HappenHallucinations aren\u2019t bugs. They\u2019re symptoms of structured resonance operating without anchors.When the model lacks grounding\u2014say, via retrieval or tightly framed prompts\u2014it still seeks to complete the pattern. It will generate plausible, fluent nonsense that fits the shape, even if it breaks truth. The structure is working, even if the facts aren\u2019t.From Compression to ReconstructionMuch of AI theory still frames these systems as compression engines: store, compress, retrieve.But LLMs offer something different:structured resonance. They rebuild meaning in the moment, using distributed activation patterns. The power isn\u2019t in what they remember\u2014it\u2019s in how they reassemble coherence in context.Design for Structured ResonanceThis insight has profound implications. If LLMs aren\u2019t thinking, but insteadresonating, then we must shift how we design systems around them.Prompting = Interface Design: Treat prompts as scaffolds, not one-offs.Structure = Stability: Use consistent tone, layout, and loops to reinforce resonance.Drift = Debug Signal: Coherence breaking down? It\u2019s a sign your structure lost alignment.RAG = Anchoring Gravity: Dense, relevant context pulls resonance toward truth.Engineering ImplicationsDesigning for structured resonance changes the engineering stack itself:Agent Design: Agents should be structured as orchestration layers that maintain coherence across tasks, not linear logic chains. Think modular, conversational state management over deep planning trees.PromptOps: Prompt engineering becomes a systems discipline. You'll need versioned, reusable prompt templates with enforced structure, scoped memory, and embedded feedback loops.Evaluation: Traditional eval metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fall short. Instead, we must measurecoherence under pressure\u2014can the model hold its tone, task, and flow across turns and failures?Debugging: Engineers should learn to recognize coherence drift the way they track memory leaks. It's a systemic fault, not a one-off glitch.Architecture: Multi-layer systems (e.g. Retrieval-Augmented Generation) must be designed toreinforce coherence, not just supply facts. Anchoring mechanisms, alignment feedback, and context shaping become first-class citizens.User Interfaces: UX needs to reflect iteration loops and contextual reinforcement\u2014not static chat boxes. Interfaces should help users co-steer resonance, not just send prompts into the void.This isn\u2019t just a new feature layer. It\u2019s a reframe of what AI engineering means.We\u2019re not building brains\u2014we\u2019re building coherence engines.Final ThoughtYou\u2019re not talking to a thinker. You\u2019re standing in front of a mirror with 8,001 dimensions. The model doesn\u2019t understand you\u2014but it reflects back a shape that feels like it does.That\u2019s the trap.Stop chasing intelligence. Start designing for structured resonance.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

They helped us tame complexity, align on good design, and enforce structure where chaos threatened.But here\u2019s the thing no one wants to say out loud:a lot of it was about control.We shaped our code not because it was always better \u2014 but because it was safer. Easier to read, easier to change (sometimes), and easier to onboard humans. We made rules for each other to protect us from entropy.SOLID walked so FLUID could flow. AI-native development doesn\u2019t need control \u2014 it needs adaptability.But that world assumed ahuman-only audience. Now we write code that\u2019s read, interpreted, and modified by machines too.We\u2019re not just collaborating with people anymore \u2014 we\u2019re collaborating with intelligence.The rules change when your pair programmer never sleeps, sees the whole codebase, and can rewrite a service in seconds.We\u2019re not in the SOLID era anymore. We\u2019re in theFLUIDera.Introducing FLUID: Post-SOLID Principles for AI-Native DevelopmentWhen you\u2019re building with AI, you don\u2019t need to contort your mind to remember every design pattern or abstract perfectly. You write what works \u2014 and if it doesn\u2019t, you regenerate, refactor, or restructure with a prompt.Code is no longer sacred. It\u2019s disposable. Mutable. Co-authored with a machine.The new principles of software development aren\u2019t about rigidity \u2014 they\u2019re about adaptability.FLUIDis a mindset for workingwithAI,not trying to preserve an artifact against time.\ud83c\udf00 FLUID PrinciplesF \u2013Flexible CompositionDesign in loosely coupled, swappable parts. Think composability over inheritance, simple functions over deep hierarchies. Anything that helps AI (or you) reshape it later.L \u2013Live PrototypesWork live. Build in hot environments \u2014 REPLs, notebooks, dev servers \u2014 to explore ideas and tighten your feedback loop. But don\u2019t stop there: snapshot working prototypes and harden them through tests, CI, and version control.FLUID doesn\u2019t mean skipping rigor \u2014 it means deferring it until you\u2019ve found something worth solidifying.U \u2013Unified ContextCode with context. Focus on reducing ambiguity \u2014 your future self, teammates, and AI assistants will all benefit. Think less about documentation and more about supplying the system with meaningful, actionable information.I \u2013Intent-Driven StructureDon\u2019t just write for form, write for collaboration. Give functions, files, and variables meaningful names, but remember \u2014 the AI is reading too. Use comments to convey intent clearly, not just style. Prioritize clarity ofwhyso the system \u2014 human and machine \u2014 stays in sync.D \u2013Dynamic RefactorabilityExpect change. Encourage it. Make code easy to mutate, regenerate, and improve. Let the AI reshape your logic, reroll your structures, and keep the system flowing.The Shift: From Code as Artifact to Code as InterfaceWe used to write code for humans to read. Now we write it so humansand machinescan collaborate on it. AI doesn\u2019t care if your service is SOLID. It cares if it can parse, learn, adapt, and ship.We\u2019re moving faster. Thinking faster. Innovating on the edges and polishing later \u2014 if ever. What used to be weeks of code review and refactoring can now be done in seconds. The bottleneck isn\u2019t the code anymore. It\u2019s your imagination.So long live SOLID.It taught us how to think.But the world has changed.Let\u2019s move. Let\u2019s break things.Let\u2019s build with machines, not for them.But Wait \u2014 Not All Code Will Be FLUID (Yet)Let\u2019s be real: some codebases aren\u2019t ready for this. There\u2019s still plenty of mission-critical, high-risk, legacy infrastructure out thereand some faction of old-school engineers will keep guarding that temple.Let them. Their job is stability.The FLUID mindset isn\u2019t a universal replacement. It\u2019s aforkin the evolutionary tree. Where stability and compliance reign, SOLID still makes sense. But if you\u2019re building something new? If you\u2019re prototyping, experimenting, innovating?Code doesn\u2019t need to be pretty to explore \u2014 it just needs to work. Then regenerated. Then evolved. You can always bring the AI in later to \u201cmake it SOLID-ish\u201d if needed.Is FLUID the Only Way?FLUID is one lens \u2014 a mindset for AI-native dev. But it\u2019s not the only one. You might resonate more with:Declarative orchestrationModel-driven programmingOr something new that hasn\u2019t even been named yetThat\u2019s the beauty of this moment: we\u2019re in acreative explosion. FLUID isn\u2019t a new dogma \u2014 it\u2019s aninvitation to break the old ones. The point isn\u2019t to replace SOLID with another rigid system.It\u2019s to open the floodgates.Bring your lens. Name your style. Let\u2019s expand the language of how we build with AI.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

The future of software is collaborative, fast, and evolving beyond the keyboard.For decades, writing code was the bottleneck.Typing was thinking.Craft was king.We taught principles like SOLID and Clean Code not just for quality, but because they werenecessary survival toolsin a world where humans were the engine behind every line of logic.But that world is changing.The New RealityAI-assisted coding \u2014 what some callvibe coding\u2014 is just the next step in the long arc of automation.It's not magic.It's not heresy.It's automation for a labor-intensive task: turning ideas into working code.And just like every wave of automation before it \u2014 from manufacturing to agriculture to graphic design \u2014it feels disorienting for those whose skills were tightly coupled to the manual process.So What's Actually Changing?The bottleneck has moved.Old bottleneck:\u201cHow do we write this?\u201dNew bottleneck:\u201cWhat are we trying to build?\u201d\u201cDoes it solve the problem?\u201d\u201cIs it safe, maintainable, and aligned with our goals?\u201dAI doesn't replace engineering.But itreplaces the idea that engineering = typing.The Role of Craft, RevisitedThe craft of software used to be abouthowwe wrote the code.Now, the craft is shifting toward:Framing and refining problemsValidating ideas quicklyNavigating ambiguityDesigning architectures that flex, scale, and adaptSOLID still matters \u2014 but only if the system benefits from it.Clean Code still matters \u2014 but AI can enforce formatting now.Unit tests still matter \u2014 but maybe you generate them from examples.In other words:Craft isn\u2019t gone \u2014 it\u2019s just moved up the stack.What This Means for EngineersThis is our automation moment.Some folks will double down on old habits and feel disillusioned.Others will evolve and thrive by shifting from control to orchestration.You don\u2019t have to be an expert in everything.But youdoneed to:Understand what you\u2019re buildingGuide the AI, not just prompt itReview and reason, not just shipVibe coding works best when you can think clearly \u2014 not just code fluently.Final ThoughtSoftware engineering is not dying.It\u2019sevolving.Faster than many expected.And like every profession that\u2019s been touched by automation, those who adapt will shape the future.Those who don\u2019t\u2026 may cling to an idea that stopped being true.We\u2019re not replacing engineers.We\u2019re replacing the need to handwrite everything just to deliver value.The ceremony is collapsing.The creativity is just beginning.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

A new ICLR paper backs my theory: coherence, not cognition, drives meaning. These models flow through context, not thought. That shift changes how we prompt, evaluate, and design with AI.Travis FrisingerApr 21, 2025\u20222 min readA visualization of coherence in motion\u2014language as flowing structure, not discrete thought.In my white paperAI Coherence: Meaning from Patterns, Not Memory, I argued that LLMs don\u2019t think in the traditional sense. They don\u2019t reason symbolically. They don\u2019t even operate over discrete chunks of meaning the way humans intuitively process language. Instead, they construct meaning throughcoherence\u2014 the internal alignment of context over time. They are coherence engines, not cognitive agents.A newly released ICLR 2025 paper,Language Models Are Implicitly Continuous, now gives empirical and mathematical weight to this idea.The Core Finding: Language is Treated as ContinuousDespite being trained on discrete tokens, LLMs behave as though they are interpreting language ascontinuous in time and space. The authors introduce a continuous extension of the Transformer architecture that doesn't change model weights but allows us to view LLM behavior as a flow over continuous functions.Through clever experiments, they demonstrate that:LLMs responddifferentlywhen thedurationof a token is varied.Interpolations between token embeddings (e.g., halfway between \u201capple\u201d and \u201cbanana\u201d) producemeaningful, plausible outputs.Pretrained models treat intermediate, never-before-seen vectors assemantic entities.This behavior suggests that LLMs operate over a smooth latent space where meaning is shaped by alignment and flow rather than symbolic inference.Coherence Theory Meets ContinuityThis paper validates a core tenet of my Coherence Theory:LLMs don't know things. They don't calculate. They align. They produce outputs thatfit\u2014 not because they understand, but because those outputs preserve contextual coherence.What the paper shows is that this coherence isn't just metaphorical. It\u2019sliterally continuous. Token durations modulate model behavior in ways humans can\u2019t intuit. Embedding space isn't just a lookup table; it's a terrain offluid meaning. And most importantly, this fluidity is what makes LLMs so powerful, and so alien.Implications for AI System DesignIf LLMs operate through continuous coherence, not discrete reasoning, then most current design assumptions need to be updated. Here's how:1.Prompt EngineeringPrompts aren't instructions. They're boundary conditions on a coherence field. You're shaping the flow of meaning, not issuing commands.2.Agent DesignAgents don\u2019t pursue goals like thinkers. They simulate coherence toward a goal when it\u2019s kept in context. Agency has to bescaffolded, not assumed.3.EvaluationTraditional metrics (accuracy, truthfulness) miss the point. You have to evaluate whether the outputfitsthe intent, the tone, the prior flow. Think: narrative alignment, not just correctness.4.InterpretabilityWe shouldn\u2019t just trace neuron activations. We should ask: what shape is this model holding? What trajectory is coherence pulling it toward?This Isn\u2019t Just Theory AnymoreThis new research paper gives us the math. It gives us experiments. But more importantly, it gives us language to talk about what so many of us have felt when working with these models:They don\u2019t think. They don\u2019t plan. They flow.And that flow iscoherence over time,not cognition.If you want to understand what LLMs really are and how to work with them effectively, you have to reframe your mental model. Start with coherence.For a deeper exploration of this paradigm shift, check out my white paper:\ud83d\udcc4AI Coherence: Meaning From Patterns, Not MemoryAI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

This blog explores why the highest-leverage skill in modern engineering is architecting the right problem, not just solving one efficiently. Thinking is the new engineering.Travis FrisingerApr 9, 2025\u20224 min readFraming over building: In a world of AI-generated solutions, the real craft lies in shaping the problem.In the age of GenAI, the ground beneath the software industry is shifting fast. Code is no longer the bottleneck. It\u2019s not even the moat. The true differentiator now lies upstream, in the space where problems are framed, not just solved.Let\u2019s dive into what it means to\"architect the right problem to solve\"and why this mindset is fast becoming the highest-leverage skill in modern engineering.From Solution Architecture to Problem ArchitectureBefore we jump into code or tooling, we have to pause and ask: are we solving the right thing in the first place?Traditional software architecture asked:\u201cHow do we best build this system given requirements X, Y, Z?\u201dModern problem architecture asks:\u201cWhy are we building this system at all? Who decided on X, Y, Z? What if we reframed the entire premise?\u201dInstead of optimizing for delivery,we optimize for clarity. We uncover assumptions buried in old specifications, and challenge the mental models shaping them. Often, the real breakthrough doesn\u2019t come from better execution, but from better framing.Shifting from a narrow, solution-driven approach to a broader, problem-framing perspective opens up new insights before a single line of code is written.This shift matters because tools likeCursororClinecan already handle many implementation details.The role of the human engineer becomes less about instruction writingor finding the perfect abstraction, and more about curiosity, hypothesis framing, and reframing the playing field entirely.The Strategic Shift: Thinking as the ProductSoftware used to be the product. Now,thinkingis the product.Think of how many startups pivot not because they couldn't build, but because they were building the wrong thing.In a GenAI-enabled environment, the build phase is cheap.The explore, hypothesize, and shape phase is where all the value lives.This makes the ability to navigate ambiguous, complex domains more important than ever:Are we solving the root problem, or just a visible symptom?Have we asked why enough times to find the real need?Could we shift the value proposition without shipping a single feature?Being able to explore the problem space with the same rigor we once reserved for technical design is the new strategic skill.Why This Matters Now: The Collapse of Differentiation in CodeLet\u2019s face it: CRUD is dead weight\u2014AI can handle most commodity development tasks today. In greenfield or straightforward scenarios, code generation can dramatically reduce development time. However, that doesn\u2019t meanallsoftware is equally commoditized.Expert Code Still Has Its PlaceSome engineering challenges still demand deep expertise. High-performance computing, distributed systems, embedded systems, specialized cryptographic protocols, and complex integrations often require nuanced craftsmanship.AI-generated solutions can handle much of the \u201c80%\u201d work, but real engineering depth is still needed to fine-tune performance, ensure resilience, or meet unique domain constraints.The bottom line: code as a commoditydoesn\u2019tmean code is unimportant. It means the straightforward aspects of coding are no longer a differentiator\u2014the skill gap shiftstoward specialized or highly optimized scenarios.As a result, the real magic for many teams lies in how theyframe the problem, model their system, and discover hidden feedback loops. If you\u2019re building a standard app that simply stores data and shows it in a UI,you\u2019re no longer special by virtue of shipping code.But if you\u2019re pushing boundaries\u2014either in performance or in problem framing\u2014then you\u2019re playing in a domain where AI alone can\u2019t do the heavy lifting yet.Systems Thinking as Problem ArchitectureThinking like a systems designer is core to problem architecture:Where are the loops that amplify or dampen behavior?Where does friction accumulate and why?What interventions create cascading effects?Instead of thinking linearly (feature \u2192 user action \u2192 value), we begin to model feedback loops, leverage points, and ecosystem incentives. The best problem architects can simulate outcomes mentally before a line of code is written.Sometimes a better system isn\u2019t more software.It might be a change in defaults, a clearer policy, or a better metaphor. In this way, problem architecture borrows from service design, game design, and systems dynamics.Roles Are EvolvingAs problem-framing becomes central to building with AI, the responsibilities across teams are beginning to shift in meaningful ways.Theengineerbecomes a design-thinker with systems intuition.Thearchitectbecomes a problem strategist and facilitator.ThePMbecomes a curator of problem spaces and opportunity framings.The dividing lines between roles blur. Cross-functional teams who co-own the problem space will outperform siloed teams with well-defined but poorly understood requirements.When code is cheap and easily generated, strategic thinking becomes the true differentiator.In this landscape, the ones who rise are those who can:Ask great questions,Sense patterns and weak signals,Navigate ambiguity with clarity.Heuristics for Better Problem ArchitectureHere are some tactical tools to use when shaping the problem:Inverse the problem.If onboarding takes too long, ask: What would make onboarding irrelevant? Could we auto-provision? Could we reduce the need to onboard at all?Zoom in / out.What if this problem doesn\u2019t exist at this scale? Zoom out: is onboarding even the real pain? Zoom in: is the delay caused by one field or one decision?Redefine success.Instead of \u201cshow a dashboard,\u201d ask: What would make a user feel confident without needing a dashboard? Can we use nudges, summaries, or natural language interfaces instead?Model friction.Where do users stall, click away, or ask for help? Friction is often a signal of a deeper mismatch in mental models.Design from the future.If the ideal experience already existed, what would have to be true? This lets you work backward from a better future instead of forward from today\u2019s constraints.The Road Ahead: Thinking as a First-Class RoleWe\u2019re heading toward an industry where \"problem architects\" will be first-class citizens:People who frame.People who think in loops.People who know that the right problem, precisely framed, is already 80% solved.They will use AI toexplore solution spacequickly, not just execute it. They will operate like designers, researchers, and strategists all in one. Theirimpact will be measured in better decisions, not just better deployments.This is the dawn ofthinking as engineering. And in this new paradigm, toarchitect the right problem is to engineer the future.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

It\u2019s not just another tooling update. It\u2019s a full-spectrum change inhow ideas become code\u2014faster, more fluid, more assistive, and more collaborative.A recent lecture by Don Syme (KCL, March 2025) inspired me to reflect on my 30+ years of writing software. From GCC and Vim, flipping through printed manuals to AI-powered co-creation. This piece is a personal tracing of that arc.AI-assisted coding is no longer a novelty. It\u2019s quickly becoming thedefault modefor modern software development. But the story isn\u2019t just about the latest tools\u2014it\u2019s about how they reflect deeper changes in how developersthink, interact,and build.To understand why AI-assisted coding is taking over, let\u2019s trace the arc that brought us here.Phase 1: Pinpoint Surgery (2022\u20132023)AI entered the dev world not with a bang, but with an autocomplete.The first wave of AI in development\u2014GitHub Copilot and Cody \u2014focused onpinpoint assistance. You were already in the code, and the AI helped with completions, summaries, or boilerplate generation. Magic, but localized.But this wasn\u2019t the first time developers wrestled with a paradigm shift in tooling.I still remember the year 2000.We were writing C++ inBorland\u2019s Turbo C++, a full-screen DOS-style environment. No real autocomplete, no inline docs, no jump-to-definition. You memorized headers, flipped through manuals, and debugged withprintf.Around the same time,Java IDEs like Eclipse were just starting to emerge, clunky and bloated but showing the promise of structured tooling.And when autocomplete first arrived, it was met with skepticism\u2014especially in academic circles.My professors warned us:\u201cDon\u2019t use that. It\u2019ll ruin your ability to look things up.\u201dBut even then, the writing was on the wall.Autocomplete wasn\u2019t cheating. It wasshorthand. It let you move faster, focus on what mattered, and worry less about the mechanics of syntax. You didn\u2019t need to remember every method in the Java Collections Framework\u2014you just needed to recognize the right one when it appeared.And gradually, the expectations shifted.You didn\u2019t have to implement a red-black tree to understand sorted sets.You didn\u2019t need to write your own hash map to understand lookup performance.Youusedthose tools. You didn\u2019t rebuild them.The same thing is happening now with AI-assisted coding.The anxiety today sounds just like it did back then\u2014only now the fear is:\u201cIf the AI writes your function, do you even understand what it\u2019s doing?\u201dBut here\u2019s the truth:You didn\u2019t need to memorize APIs in 2000.You don\u2019t need to memorize boilerplate in 2025.What matters is still the same:Do you understand the problem?Can you debug what you didn\u2019t write?Can you build something that works and lasts?AI is just the next layer in that ongoing evolution\u2014from raw code to composed systems, from memorization to orchestration.Phase 2: Task-Oriented Coding (2024)Then the paradigm began to shift.Rather than only assisting at thepoint of code, tools likeCopilot Workspace, orCursor Composerstarted focusing onthe intent behind the task\u2014the bug you wanted to fix, the feature you wanted to add, the repo-level change you were imagining.Suddenly, the AI could help:Scaffold new features end to endInterpret GitHub issues and create PRsGenerate files and connect systemsMove beyond code to thetask behind the codeThis changed the relationship. The AI stopped waiting for you to act\u2014and started meeting you at the level ofintent.\u201cBefore code comes intent. Before pull requests come words.\u201d\u2014 Don SymeThis was a massive unlock. Code became not just the destination, but part of a dynamic conversation between you, the AI, and the repo.Phase 3: Vibe Coding - From Collaboration to Delegation (2025)Whether it\u2019s an AI suggesting a line of code, refactoring a module, or generating an entire app from scratch\u2014the interface is the same:language.You describe what you want. The machine figures out how to make it happen.It\u2019s allvibe coding, as Andrej Karpathy aptly stated:\u201cYou don\u2019t write code; you vibe with the system until it gives you what you want.\u201dBut here\u2019s the important axis:SWE-Agents=collaborative vibe codingYou co-create. You review. You guide the agent through complex workflows across your codebase.App generators=delegated vibe codingYou hand off the task entirely. You prompt once. The AI returns a product. You may or may not ever see the code.Both are powered by prompting.Both abstract away syntax.Both change what \u201ccoding\u201d means.But they differ inintentandcontrol.\ud83e\udde0 Collaborative Vibe CodingUsed in SWE-agents likeDevinorClaude Code, or in chat-oriented IDEs likeWindsurf(with features likeCascade):Modify existing systemsChain reasoning stepsKeep you in the loopGreat for common problems, boilerplate and architecture-aware changesYou stay close. You edit, refine, redirect.You're still engineering, just with superpowers.\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Delegated Vibe CodingUsed in full-app tools likeSparkorLovable:Start from zeroOutput full-stack codebasesGive you a live preview or deploy-ready buildIdeal for simple MVPs, demosor UI prototypesYou hand it off. You react to the result.You\u2019re product shaping, not engineering line-by-line.The distinction isn\u2019t technical\u2014it\u2019s relational.Are you pairing with the AI or managing it like an intern?That\u2019s the real evolution. And it\u2019s still early.In the next wave, we\u2019ll likely see hybrid modes emerge:You delegate first, then switch to collaborateThe AI scaffolds an app, then becomes your agent in the repoTeams work with AI in real-time sessions\u2014pair programming becomes pairorchestrationVibe coding is just the start.What we\u2019re really learning is how to collaborate with machines.So\u2026 Why Is AI-Assisted Coding Taking Over?Because it compresses the loop between thought and execution.Because it augments capability without waiting for perfection.Because it makes developers feel like magicians again, where intent and impact are tightly coupled.It doesn\u2019t replace the craft. It reshapes it.Final Thought: This Is Just the BeginningAI-assisted development isn't a product feature. It's aparadigm shift. The IDE is becoming acollaborative space, not a solo sandbox. The next generation of developers will build faster\u2014but only if we teach them to think deeply, question outputs, and remain thehuman in the loop.The future belongs to those who know how tothink with machines, not just type faster.I\u2019ve lived through many shifts\u2014from CLI compilers and manuals to IDEs with autocomplete and now, collaborative agents. But this one feels different. This one feels like the first time we\u2019re coding withsomeoneinstead ofsomething.Let\u2019s vibe forward.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

Passive use leads to automation bias, but iteration and refinement unlock value and creativity. AI isn't an autopilot. It is a thought partner! The more we engage, the better our results.Travis FrisingerMar 9, 2025\u20222 min readAI\u2019s potential isn\u2019t unlocked through automation. Instead it\u2019s unlocked through engagement. The more we iterate, the more value and creativity we uncover.I never planned on studying my ChatGPT interactions in depth, but after thousands of sessions, I began noticing clear patterns\u2014both promising and worrisome. Sometimes, ChatGPT was a brilliant thought partner, sparking new ideas and refining my thinking. Other times, I fell into the trap of automation bias, accepting answers without a second thought.The AI Decision Loop: A Framework for Smarter GenAI UseTo understand these patterns, I analyzed 2,500 of my own conversations and developed a framework I call theAI Decision Loop\u2014a five-step process to maximize AI\u2019s benefits while avoiding its pitfalls:Frame the Decision Context\u2013 Define constraints, assumptions, and the problem.AI Output Generation & Thought Partnership\u2013 Treat AI as a collaborator, not a magic box.Apply Human Judgment\u2013 Challenge AI\u2019s responses, ask for justification.Verify & Validate\u2013 Fact-check for reliability, especially in high-stakes tasks.Refine & Iterate\u2013 Learn from interactions, improve prompts, and automate selectively.AI Decision LoopThis loop mirrors principles from Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming, underscoring the value of iterative refinement and structured engagement over blind acceptance. For a more in-depth exploration of each step, complete with nuanced insights and practical examples, check out thefull paper.Key Findings from 2500 ConversationsHere are some of the biggest takeaways from my analysis:34% of the time, I exited after Stage 1, showing potential automation bias.74% of the time, I exhibited pairing behaviorwith the AI, engaging in back-and-forth refinement.63% of the time, I demonstrated AI-driven decision-making, meaning I used AI as a co-pilot rather than an autopilot.Only 28% of the time did I use AI to critique its own work or mine, highlighting a missed opportunity for deeper collaboration.When I followed the full AI Decision Loop, my results were significantly better\u2014clearer ideas and better insights.These structured engagement behaviors strongly correlate with higher loop completion rates. The high success rates observed in AI partnership (74%) and AI critique (98%) suggest that structured collaboration may lead to more refined results.The Paradox of AI-Assisted ThinkingAI makes iteration easy, yet its convenience tempts us to shortcut the process. This \u201cstrange loop\u201d of AI-assisted thinking can either amplify our intelligence through rigorous collaboration or degrade it into passive automation if we choose to not engage.The TakeawayAI doesn\u2019t inherently make us smarter, but our structured engagement does. By actively collaborating with AI, we turn it from a mere tool into an adaptive partner that evolves with our thinking. This is not about letting AI run on autopilot; it is about harnessing its power to augment our abilities.In knowledge work, software development, and decision-making, moving beyond passive consumption to embrace a structured, iterative dialogue is key.Augmentation over automation is not just a philosophy, it is the path to unlocking AI as a true force multiplier.Take a moment to reflect on your own interactions with AI.

Most AI tools still demand large amounts of effort. This post explores how GenAI must evolve to provide true utility, removing friction and integrating smoothly into everyday workflows.Travis FrisingerMar 4, 2025\u20225 min readAI experiences should be as seamless as a touchless car washI thought of this the other day while getting my car washed. As I sat there waiting, I realized how effortless the entire experience had become. What used to be a manual, labor-intensive task had been refined through automation into something simple:put money in, drive forward, and wait.No complex steps, no extra effort, just a system that works.It made me think: why doesn\u2019t AI feel this seamless? And what would it take to get there?Most AI tools today still require too much effort with tweaking prompts, refining outputs, and adapting to the AI rather than the other way around. If AI is going to deliver real utility, it needs to evolve the same way car washes did. It should be frictionless, adaptive, and truly useful without requiring constant manual adjustment.This sparked the idea ofThe Touchless Car Wash Approach to GenAI, a set of guiding principles for designing AI that integrates effortlessly into workflows, delivering value without extra cognitive load.If we can automate something as complex as cleaning a car down to a simple drive-through experience, why can\u2019t AI do the same for knowledge work?The Core IdeaA truly touchless GenAI experience should remove the cognitive and operational friction of AI adoption. Instead of forcing users to adapt to AI, the AI should integrate effortlessly into workflows, delivering value without requiring extra effort. The key is autonomy, personalization, and intelligence, much like a touchless car wash that adapts to each vehicle\u2019s needs with minimal user input.What GenAI Can Learn from a Touchless Car WashImagine pulling into a touchless car wash. You don\u2019t have to scrub, rinse, or even step out of your vehicle. The system scans your car, adapts to its shape and delivers an optimized cleaning experience with minimal effort on your part.Now, contrast this with most AI-powered products today.You often need to fine-tune prompts just to get a useful response.The AI isn\u2019t context-aware, forcing you to re-enter the same details repeatedly.Outputs require significant manual refinement, reducing efficiency instead of enhancing it.This is the gap in AI today. AI products should work for the user, not the other way around.To achieve this, GenAI products must be frictionless, intelligent, and seamlessly integrated. Below are ten key guiding principles for building high-value AI products, inspired by the simplicity and efficiency of a touchless car wash.10 Principles for Touchless GenAI1. Minimize Friction, Maximize Utility\u2705 A touchless car wash doesn\u2019t ask you to lather your own soap. AI shouldn\u2019t ask users to do extra work either.Great AI should feel effortless. Users shouldn\u2019t have to craft perfect prompts, manually format responses, or toggle endless settings to get a useful result.\ud83d\udd39Example:Instead of requiring precise prompting, an AI assistant should actively clarify vague requests, automatically rephrase poorly structured inputs, and adjust settings based on past interactions.2. Deliver Instant, High-Impact Results\u2705 A good car wash cleans your car fast. A good AI product delivers immediate value.Users should see instant, meaningful impact without needing extensive onboarding or training. AI should accelerate workflows, not create more steps.\ud83d\udd39Example:Instead of just summarizing meeting notes, AI should generate actionable next steps, draft follow-up emails, and even propose project updates in real time.3. Be Context-Aware and Adaptive\u2705 A touchless car wash adjusts for different car sizes and surface materials. AI should be just as adaptive.GenAI should understand context, not just at a prompt level but across workflows and long-term interactions. It should anticipate needs, remember preferences, and tailor outputs dynamically.\ud83d\udd39Example:A GenAI writing assistant that adapts to your tone and style over time instead of generating generic, one-size-fits-all content.4. Prioritize Actionability Over Novelty\u2705 A car wash doesn\u2019t just spray soap for show. It ensures the car is actually clean.Too many AI tools focus on \"impressive\" outputs rather than usable results. AI should move beyond information retrieval and novelty to deliver next-step actionability.\ud83d\udd39Example:Instead of simply analyzing a dataset, a GenAI system should surface insights, recommend strategic actions, and automate reporting to reduce cognitive load on users.5. Close the AI-User Feedback Loop\u2705 The best car washes improve their process based on customer needs. AI should do the same.AI shouldn\u2019t require users to explicitly provide feedback to improve. It should learn from implicit signals such as which outputs get edited, accepted, or ignored and refine itself accordingly.\ud83d\udd39Example:An AI coding assistant that learns from your corrections and adapts its suggestions without forcing you to manually re-train it.6. Ensure Explainability and Trustworthiness\u2705 A car wash doesn\u2019t hide what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s transparent about the process. AI should be too.Users need to trust AI outputs without spending time fact-checking every response. AI should provide explainability, confidence levels, and sources when relevant.\ud83d\udd39Example:Instead of just giving an answer, AI should cite sources, highlight reasoning, and provide alternative perspectives when uncertainty is high.7. Make AI Work for the User, Not the Other Way Around\u2705 You don\u2019t have to change your car to fit a car wash. AI should fit seamlessly into your workflow.AI should adapt to human workflows rather than forcing people to learn a new system. A great AI experience integrates fluidly into existing tools, processes, and environments.\ud83d\udd39Example:An AI-powered knowledge assistant that automatically enhances documents, spreadsheets, or presentations rather than requiring users to jump into a separate AI tool.8. Emphasize Collaboration Over Replacement\u2705 A car wash doesn\u2019t replace the driver. It just makes their life easier.AI should augment and empower humans, not aim for full automation where human judgment is still valuable. The best AI products are co-pilots, not replacements.\ud83d\udd39Example:A brainstorming AI that asks clarifying questions and refines ideas rather than just generating content with no context or critical thought.9. Maintain Ethical and Privacy-First AI Design\u2705 Just like car washes use eco-friendly water systems, AI should be built responsibly.Trustworthy AI is privacy-conscious, bias-aware, and designed with user control in mind. Ethical design isn\u2019t an afterthought. It\u2019s fundamental to adoption and long-term success.\ud83d\udd39Example:AI that processes as much data locally as possible, minimizes personal data collection, and allows users to control what AI learns from them.10. Build for Continuous, Effortless Improvement\u2705 A great car wash keeps getting better. AI should too.AI products shouldn\u2019t be static. They should continuously learn, refine, and improve in a way that feels natural and invisible to the user.\ud83d\udd39Example:A personal AI assistant that remembers past conversations, improves recommendations based on long-term engagement, and proactively suggests better workflows over time.The Future of GenAI Is TouchlessIf GenAI products truly embraced the touchless car wash mindset, they would become frictionless, intelligent, and seamlessly valuable.We wouldn\u2019t have to fight with prompts, correct AI mistakes, or struggle to integrate AI into our workflows. Instead, AI would simply work, providing context-aware, real-time assistance that enhances our productivity and creativity effortlessly.The future of AI isn\u2019t about doing more to get AI to work.It\u2019s about removing work entirely so AI delivers value without friction.The best AI feels like magic. It\u2019s time to build AI that disappears into the background so humans can stay in the foreground.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

It was simple\u2014just a starting point, more of an experiment than a statement. At the time, I wasn\u2019t sure where this journey would lead, but I knew one thing: writing forces clarity.Over the past year, this blog has become more than just a collection of thoughts. It\u2019s been a space to explore ideas, challenge assumptions, and document the evolving landscape of AI, engineering, and strategy. Looking back, I can see how much has changed\u2014not just in the world of technology, but in my own thinking. I feel like I\u2019m pushing the boundaries of thought, sensing the need to discuss topics just as they become relevant to the larger community.Growth in Writing, Thinking, and DirectionWriting regularly has a way of revealing patterns in thought. What started as occasional posts on AI and engineering has turned into a broader exploration of AI literacy, strategy, and the hidden challenges of working with AI in real-world applications. Each post has pushed me to refine my ideas, forcing me to articulate concepts that might otherwise remain vague.Beyond writing, this year has been about action\u2014building projects, engaging in deep conversations, and pushing forward in areas that matter. From technical deep dives to AI governance discussions, I\u2019ve found that the more I write, the more I engage with others who share similar interests. Writing has become a tool not just for thinking, but for connection.Looking Forward: The Next YearAs I look ahead, the next chapter of this journey is clear: turning these insights into a three-part book series calledNavigating AI. This series will cover everything from AI literacy for knowledge workers, to engineering agent based systems, to executive strategy - all while leveraging GenAI as a force multiplier for teams.This blog has laid the groundwork, and now it\u2019s time to dive deeper. Expect more explorations of how GenAI is reshaping work, more reflections on building with GenAI, and more practical insights into harnessing GenAI\u2019s potential at every level.If the past year has taught me anything, it\u2019s that writing isn\u2019t just about documenting what I already know\u2014it\u2019s about pushing myself to see what I haven\u2019t yet considered.

Real-world case studies show its greatest value lies in intangible benefits like better communication, faster innovation, and improved efficiency\u2014often beyond what traditional ROI metrics can capture.Travis FrisingerFeb 17, 2025\u20222 min readHarnessing the Invisible: AI-Driven Innovation Transforming Knowledge WorkIn my previous blog,The GenAI Value Dilemma: Measuring the Invisible Gains of Knowledge Work Augmentation, I explored the challenge of quantifying the benefits of GenAI in knowledge work. Today, let\u2019s go beyond theory and examine real-world case studies where organizations have successfully implemented GenAI, not by obsessing over immediate ROI, but by embracing the intangible value it creates.Allstate Insurance: Humanizing Customer Communication with GenAIAllstate adopted GenAI to craft empathetic and clear customer communications, replacing jargon-heavy messages with AI-generated content that resonates with customers. The AI now authors over 50,000 communications daily, enhancing customer satisfaction. The invisible gain? Improved client relationships and trust, leading to higher retention rates\u2014a benefit that can't be captured in a simple cost-saving metric.Key Takeaway:Allstate's success stems from leveraging GenAI for better communication, not just operational efficiency, demonstrating that the most impactful benefits often lie beyond the balance sheet.JPMorgan Chase: Empowering Employees with GenAI AssistanceJPMorgan's LLM Suite helps employees draft emails, summarize documents, and retrieve information efficiently. This tool has fostered a culture of productivity and competition, where teams strive to utilize GenAI effectively. The invisible gain? Enhanced employee productivity and morale, which directly influence the company's overall performance.Key Takeaway:By focusing on augmenting human work, JPMorgan highlights that GenAI's true value is often in enabling employees to perform better, faster, and smarter.Coca-Cola: Innovating with GenAI in Product DevelopmentCoca-Cola used GenAI to create the limited-edition beverage 'Y3000', analyzing consumer preferences to design the product and its marketing. The invisible gain? Faster innovation cycles and more personalized products, driving consumer engagement and brand loyalty.Key Takeaway:GenAI's ability to accelerate and enhance creative processes is a significant, albeit hard-to-quantify, business advantage.Mass General Brigham: Improving Healthcare CommunicationThis healthcare system piloted GenAI tools to help physicians respond to patient messages, enhancing the quality and timeliness of patient care. The invisible gain? Reduced physician burnout and improved patient satisfaction, critical factors in healthcare success.Key Takeaway:GenAI's contribution to reducing workload and improving service quality is a prime example of its intangible benefits.Salesforce \u2013 Automating Routine Legal TasksAt Salesforce, GenAI tools are used for legal research, contract management, and tracking legal service providers. This has led to significant cost savings, including over $5 million in reduced external legal spending. The AI systems improve operational efficiency by managing unstructured data like documents and emails, allowing legal teams to focus on strategic initiatives.Key Takeaway:GenAI enhances efficiency by managing complex data, freeing legal teams for higher-value work, and demonstrating AI\u2019s hidden value in business operations.ConclusionThese case studies reinforce the central argument of my previous blog: the real value of GenAI lies in its ability to augment human capabilities, streamline complex processes, and enhance creativity\u2014often in ways that traditional ROI metrics fail to capture.As more organizations adopt GenAI, the challenge will not be in proving its worth through numbers but in recognizing and nurturing its intangible benefits. The path to successful GenAI adoption lies in strategic leadership, governance, and a willingness to embrace the unseen advantages GenAI brings to knowledge work.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

True value lies in leadership-driven strategies\u2014empowering employees, enhancing decision-making, and fostering innovation through governance, training, and clear objectives, not just metrics.Travis FrisingerFeb 17, 2025\u20222 min readBridging GenAI and Business Strategy: Unlocking Value Through Leadership and Strategic Implementation.The conversation around Generative AI (GenAI) ROI feels stuck. While traditional tools like Excel or ERP systems had clear, quantifiable benefits, GenAI's  value often feels abstract and elusive. The irony? The effort required to measure GenAI\u2019s impact can often offset the very gains it delivers. Do we need DORA for GenAI?The Paradox of GenAI ROIMeasuring the return on investment for GenAI in knowledge work is like trying to capture wind in a bottle. The process of metricizing GenAI usage\u2014tracking time saved, cognitive load reduced, or quality improved\u2014often consumes more resources than the GenAI itself saves. This paradox isn't new; similar challenges emerged during Agile transformations and the digitization of creative work.The Real Value of GenAI in Knowledge WorkGenAI is not just about automating tasks; it's about augmenting human thought, creativity, and decision-making. Its value lies in the unseen, and unlocking this value depends on leadership and governance:Faster Iteration:GenAI accelerates brainstorming, drafting, and revising when leaders encourage experimentation.Deeper Insights:GenAI tools synthesize vast information quickly when governance ensures quality standards.Cognitive Load Reduction:GenAI handles repetitive tasks, freeing humans for higher-order thinking when training empowers them to use GenAI effectively.Rethinking GenAI ROI: A Leadership-Driven ApproachInstead of seeking precision, what if we embraced leadership-driven direction?GenAI Enablement Index:Leadership-defined survey-based scores reflecting perceived GenAI augmentation.Operational Observations:Leaders tracking shorter meetings, fewer of them, faster decision-making, and smoother project flows.Anomaly Detection:Leadership monitoring fewer bottlenecks or faster turnaround as indicators of GenAI value.This approach mirrors how we measure strategic initiatives\u2014focusing on governance, policy, and vision rather than granular metrics.From ROI to Competitive Edge Through LeadershipThe real measure of GenAI in knowledge work is not time saved but opportunity unlocked through strong governance and policy. Organizations that empower employees with GenAI through training, clear guidelines, and room for experimentation will outpace those stuck in the measurement trap.A Leadership-Driven Model for GenAI MeasurementA three-tier framework could help:Operational Efficiency:Leadership ensuring GenAI reduces workload bottlenecks.Cognitive Amplification:Governance driving GenAI to expand thinking and decision capacity.Strategic Leverage:Policy enabling GenAI to open new opportunities or markets.This model encourages companies to experiment with GenAI under strong leadership without getting bogged down by impossible metrics, aligning with thought leaders like Cassie Kozyrkov, who emphasizes leadership\u2019s role in defining GenAI value.Strategic ImplementationImplementing GenAI successfully requires more than just governance; it demands a holistic strategy that includes:Data Infrastructure:Ensuring data quality, accessibility, and integration across systems.Employee Training:Providing continuous learning opportunities for employees to enhance GenAI literacy and leverage GenAI tools effectively.Cross-Functional Collaboration:Encouraging collaboration between technical and non-technical teams to identify GenAI opportunities, starting with small, iterative efforts. Invest in essential tools and training to prototype and explore solutions, then scale development once clear value is demonstrated.Iterative Deployment:Rolling out GenAI solutions in phases, gathering feedback, and continuously improving through agile methods.Clear Objectives:Defining specific goals for GenAI initiatives, aligned with broader business strategies to ensure relevance and impact.This strategic implementation ensures that GenAI initiatives are sustainable, adaptable, and aligned with business goals, making the most of GenAI's potential.In the end, the GenAI value dilemma isn't about proving every minute saved; it's about recognizing that in an age of endless right answers, the true ROI lies in leadership\u2019s ability to set policy, empower people, and seize opportunities before anyone else does.References:Kozyrkov, C.

Is Chat-Assisted Programming (CHAP) the New VBA?Excel empowered business users with macros and VBA\u2014now, ChatGPT and CHAP (Chat-Assisted Programming) are the next evolution. CHAP enables natural-language automation, bridging the gap between power users and engineers. Could CHAP be the new VBA for AI-driven workflows?Travis FrisingerFeb 10, 2025\u20227 min readThe Future of Automation: A Chatbot 'Coding' with Natural Language\u2014Is This the New Excel for Power Users?For decades, Excel has been the go-to tool for business power users. Whether analyzing large data sets, generating pivot tables, or building complex financial models, expert \u201cExcel jockeys\u201d have tackled tasks that once required dedicated developers.Macros andVBA (Visual Basic for Applications)further empowered these users, allowing them to automate processes, customize workflows, and transform spreadsheets into powerful mini-applications. If Excel democratized data manipulation, VBA was the secret sauce that enabled automation at scale.Now,ChatGPT and other Large Language Model (LLM)-based assistantsare emerging as the next universal tool\u2014one that goes beyond numbers to generate text, write code, summarize documents, and integrate with APIs. If ChatGPT is today\u2019s equivalent of Excel in terms of mass adoption and versatility, then a new form of\u201cCHAP\u201d (Chat-Assisted Programming)could be the modern analog to VBA\u2014enabling users to automate workflows through natural-language conversation instead of traditional coding.In Other Words\u2026CHAP=the art of using dialog via prompting to create software at the level VBA once provided to Excel users.Let\u2019s explore how this shift could transform the role of power users and where the \u201cLLM Curve of Impact\u201d might apply in a business context.Excel, the Original Business PlaygroundHow Excel Changed the Game for Power UsersExcel wasn\u2019t just a spreadsheet tool; it was agateway. It lowered the barrier to data manipulation and mild programming. Suddenly, you didn\u2019t need to write a compiled language or be a full-time developer to automate daily tasks or produce meaningful data insights.Formulasgave logic-building capabilities without \u201creal code.\u201dPivot tableslet you slice and dice data interactively.Macros and VBAkicked things up a notch, allowing repeated actions to be recorded, customized, and shared.The Rise of the \u201cExcel Jockey\u201dEnter the businesspower user\u2014the finance analyst, operations manager, or project coordinator who mastered Excel. They might not have had a formal CS degree, but they made Excel sing. Their \u201chacky\u201d macros could handle data merges, produce financial dashboards, or automate entire workflows. For many companies, these Excel-based solutions became mission-critical \u201cmini apps.\u201dThe key is how skillfully you can orchestrate the LLM to do complex tasks\u2014just like how advanced Excel users wrote elaborate macros.Meet the New Player: ChatGPT (and Other LLMs)Why ChatGPT Feels Like Excel\u2019s Second ComingChatGPT offers a similar kind of democratization\u2014but for natural language and code generation. Instead of memorizing formula syntax, you talk to a chatbot:\u201cShow me how to solve problem XYZ.\u201d\u201cWrite a snippet of code that does ABC.\u201d\u201cSummarize these documents and highlight key insights.\u201dFor the everyday user, ChatGPT is animmediate productivity tool\u2014they can produce polished emails, generate marketing copy, or quickly draft templates. As with Excel, you don\u2019t need to be a full-stack developer. You just need to know how to phrase your question or request effectively.How Power Users Benefit\u201cExcel jockeys\u201d often handle cross-functional tasks: analyzing data, building presentations, gleaning insights, and combining them into actionable steps. With ChatGPT:They canask for data transformationsdirectly. (E.g., \u201cParse these text strings into structured data.\u201d)They cangenerate content(like writing a brief or blog post from bullet points) far faster.They canprototype codeor scripts for more advanced automations without diving deep into programming docs.But as with Excel, there\u2019s always a next-level step: customizing and automating these interactions. That\u2019s where something akin toVBAmight appear\u2026Introducing CHAP (Chat-Assisted Programming)From Macros to Conversational \u201cMacros\u201dIf ChatGPT is our modern-day Excel, then a 'CHAP' layer is how we extend its functionality\u2014just like how power users leveraged VBA to go beyond basic macros. Instead of writing VBA inside Excel, you give structured prompts and instructions to an LLM, orchestrating tasks across various apps and data sources.A simple example might be:CHAP_Script:\n  - Load \"customer_feedback.csv\"\n  - Remove duplicate entries\n  - Categorize feedback sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative\n  - Count the number of responses in each category\n  - Generate a simple bar chart showing sentiment distribution\n  - Save the chart as \"feedback_summary.png\"How CHAP Aligns with VBA\u2019s Role in ExcelFeatureVBA Macros (Excel)CHAP (LLM-Based)How Users InteractWrite VBA scripts manuallyUse structured prompts (natural language)Automation ScopeExcel tasks (data, UI, reports)Any software/API (data processing, UI, automation)Code VisibilityUser must write & manage codeCode is abstracted away but existsWho Benefits?Power users who know VBAPower users comfortable with AI tools and automation platformsThe Role of Tooling in CHAPFor CHAP to be effective, tooling that abstracts away complexity while providing execution and feedback mechanisms is crucial. Platforms likeWindsurf, which can run commands, read errors, and iteratively correct them, are essential to making CHAP workflows seamless. These tools bridge the gap between natural language automation and robust, error-free execution, ensuring that business users can rely on AI-driven automation without needing to debug raw code.Key Takeaway:CHAP still generates code, but users don\u2019t have to write or even see it\u2014unless they want to. Just like VBA macros helped power users automate workflows in Excel without deep programming skills, CHAP enables natural-language-based automation across a broader range of applications.No explicit \u201cVB-like\u201d syntax\u2014just step-by-step instructions in natural language. Under the hood, there could be more advanced logic or code, but from the user\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s all about describing what you want in plain English (or any language, really).The Power of OrchestrationThe big innovation is that LLM-based automation can reachbeyondthe confines of spreadsheets. It can:Pull from APIs,Interact with databases,Compose emails,Even handle logic or conditionals (\u201cif user is inactive for 90 days, do X\u201d).So, \u201cCHAP\u201d is less aboutexplicitly writing scriptsand more aboutdialogue-driven software creation\u2014the next evolution of macros.The LLM Curve of Impact\u2014Revisited for Power UsersSource:https://serce.me/posts/2025-02-07-the-llm-curve-of-impact-on-software-engineersIn a recent post about the \u201cLLM Curve of Impact,\u201d it looked at how different engineer levels react to ChatGPT. But if we replace \u201cjunior engineer\u201d with \u201cbusiness power user,\u201d the core idea still applies:Business Power Usersoften see a huge immediateboostfrom ChatGPT. Like how Excel macros supercharged them, LLMs fill knowledge gaps instantly and let them accomplish tasks previously out of scope.Middle-of-the-Road Usersmight hit a \u201cDanger Zone\u201d of sorts if they don\u2019t upgrade their approach. They know enough to use ChatGPT but don\u2019t quite structure prompts or chain tasks effectively.Veteran \u201cExcel Jockeys\u201dwho adopt CHAP could end up with thehighest level of impact.They know their domain inside out and can design robust workflows that harness the AI\u2019s capabilities\u2014building entire solutions from natural language \u201crecipes.\u201dThe key is how skillfully you can orchestrate the LLM to do complex tasks\u2014just like how advanced Excel users wrote elaborate macros. As in the old days, you either remain a casual spreadsheet user or learn the magic of macros. Today, you can remain a casual prompt user or embrace \u201cChat-Assisted Programming.\u201dWhy CHAP Might Be the New VBASimilaritiesEntry Point for Power Users:VBA let non-developers build real automation. CHAP likewise empowers people who aren\u2019t full-time devs to create mini-apps and workflows.Extending a Popular Tool:VBA extended Excel; CHAP extends ChatGPT or any LLM interface.Bridging the Gap:Both solutions fill that space between \u201ccasual usage\u201d and \u201cproduction-level software,\u201d enabling quick prototypes or departmental applications.DifferencesNatural Language First:VBA was still code. CHAP (in concept) uses prompts, so the user\u2019s instructions read more like conversation than lines of code.Broad Ecosystem:While VBA was mostly tied to Excel or Microsoft Office, LLM-based CHAP can integrate across the web, cloud services, internal APIs, etc.AI-Enhanced Logic:CHAP isn\u2019t just automating steps\u2014it can also interpret context, generate text, and make suggestions in real-time.Potential Danger Zone and OpportunitiesDanger ZoneJust like there was a risk of \u201cFrankenstein spreadsheets\u201d in Excel\u2014overly complex macros that no one else could maintain\u2014LLM-based workflows could become messy or insecure if not implemented carefully:Over-reliance on\u201cblack box\u201dAI can lead to mistakes or compliance issues.Using incomplete data sets or prompt engineering can produce misleading outputs.OpportunityFor those \u201cExcel jockeys\u201d who embrace structured prompt engineering (or \u201cCHAP\u201d), there\u2019s a chance to become the go-to solution provider again. Organizations will always need folks who can:Translate business problemsinto structured prompts or scripts.Validate the AI\u2019s outputfor accuracy and reliability.Documentthese new \u201cmacro flows\u201d so others can adopt and maintain them.This is how the old \u201cExcel wizard\u201d in an accounting department turned into an indispensable resource. Now, you can do it in a far broader context, bridging multiple systems and departments.A Vision for the FutureImagine a world where the business power user sits down to an AI interface and simply says:\u201cGive me a weekly pivot on our sales data, highlight the top 10% customers by volume, draft an email for each rep with an individualized summary, and log any anomalies in a shared dashboard.\u201dAnd the AI\u2013powered CHAP system does it, possibly even optimizing each step:Fetchingdata from a live sales database.Summarizingresults with context-aware analysis.Generatingpersonalized email text per account rep.Notifyingrelevant channels in Slack or Teams.No explicit coding is required, just well-crafted instructions. Sure, under the hood it\u2019s a combination of scripts, APIs, and advanced logic. But the power user is still free to refine the process in everyday language, reminiscent of how they once recorded Excel macros.Conclusion & Next StepsChatGPT or LLM-based chatbotshave the potential to become the new \u201cExcel\u201d\u2014the place where business users and power users gather to quickly get things done. And if that analogy holds, it won\u2019t be long before we see a \u201cCHAP\u201d (Chat-Assisted Programming) ecosystem\u2014a new generation ofconversational macrosornatural-language scripting.How You Can PrepareExperiment with Prompt Engineering:Learn how to phrase questions and tasks so an LLM can best help you.Think in \u201cWorkflows\u201d:Start identifying repetitive tasks or data flows that could be partially automated using chat-based interactions.Balance Trust and Verification:AI can be powerful, but always maintain checks and balances\u2014especially when dealing with critical data or external communications.In short, don\u2019t be surprised if tomorrow\u2019s \u201cExcel jockey\u201d wields an AI \u201cmacro language\u201d in a Slack channel or web interface. The skills that once made you a wizard with PivotTables and VBA can translate directly into crafting unstoppable chat-assisted workflows.Thanks for reading\u2014and welcome to the age of CHAP, where natural language just might become the new VBA.Further ReadingThe LLM Curve of Impact:For insights on how AI tools affect different experience levels.The evolution of Macros and VBA in Excel:A historical perspective on how simple recorded macros evolved into VBA-powered business-critical workflows.Author\u2019s NoteEmbracing LLM-based tools doesn\u2019t diminish the necessity of strong process knowledge and domain expertise paired with solid engineering skills. Just like the best Excel experts were those who deeply understood both the data and the tasks, the next generation of \u201cCHAP experts\u201d will be the ones who can blend AI\u2019s power with practical, real-world business logic.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

If their breakthroughs hold up in real-world adoption, they coulddisrupt the dominance of closed-source AI giantslike OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.That\u2019s why the recent release ofDeepSeek-V3 and R1, two new AI models from aChinese company, has shaken the industry. DeepSeek\u2019s claims?\u2705Comparable performance to top-tier AI modelslike Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\u2705A fraction of the cost\u2014reportedly trained for just $5M instead of hundreds of millions.\u2705Completely open-source, unlike the secretive models from OpenAI and Anthropic.While some hail this asa revolutionary moment, others\u2014likeAnthropic\u2019s CEO\u2014argue it\u2019s justan expected step in AI\u2019s cost reduction curve. So, which is it?What Makes DeepSeek\u2019s Models Special?DeepSeek\u2019s latest models introducethree major innovationsthat could reshape AI development.1. Cost-Efficient Training and Hardware UtilizationDeepSeek claims it trainedV3 for just $5M, a fraction of the$100M-$1B typically spent by OpenAI and Anthropicon similar models.This was achieved through:Smarter dataset selection, reducing redundant training data.More efficient compute usage, optimizing resource allocation.Mixture of Experts (MoE), which activates only necessary parts of the model per query.Reality Check:The $5M claim is impressive, but there is skepticism thatDeepSeek still relied on 50,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs (~$1B worth of hardware).If True, the real breakthrough isn\u2019t in how little they spent\u2014buthow efficiently they trained at this scale.2. Mixture of Experts (MoE) for Smarter, Cheaper AIMost large modelsactivate all their parametersfor every response, making them expensive to run.DeepSeek-V3uses MoE, selectively activatingonly the most relevant portionsof the model per query\u2014reducing costs while maintaining high performance.While MoE itselfisn\u2019t new(Google and OpenAI have experimented with it),DeepSeek is the first to scale it effectively and open-source it, making the approach more accessible than ever.Reality Check:While MoE has been touted as a game-changer for AI efficiency, it\u2019s never been fully adopted due tocomplexity and latency concerns. DeepSeek\u2019s success, however, signals thatMoE might be hitting its stride at scale, offering a viable challenge to theresource-hungry dense models. That said, if real-world applications exposelatency or quality issues, dense models may still hold the upper hand.3. Open-Source Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) LearningDeepSeek-R1learns step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL), rather than relying on human-curated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training data.This method is similar to OpenAI\u2019so1 model, but DeepSeek\u2019s true breakthrough is infully open-sourcing not just the model, but the entire training process, allowing anyone to replicate and refine it.Reality Check:OpenAI and others have paved the way with CoT reasoning, but their methods are locked behind closed doors. DeepSeek\u2019s move to release afully transparent, RL-trained CoT modelis agame-changing leap for AI accessibility. But open-sourcing doesn\u2019t guarantee success\u2014without a thriving developer community, the model couldstagnate. Plus, with the rise of advanced, open-source reasoning models,security and governance issuesbecome critical, especially as AI\u2019s geopolitical influence grows.By makinghigh-performance AI reasoning open-source, DeepSeek ischallenging the dominance of Silicon Valley giants, potentially shifting the AI development landscape toward greater accessibility and innovation.Anthropic\u2019s Response: Downplaying the DisruptionAnthropic CEO\u2019s response to DeepSeek was notablydismissive:DeepSeek is just following a \u201cnatural\u201d cost-reduction trend, not revolutionizing AI.DeepSeek\u2019s efficiency is overstated\u2014it still needed massive hardware investments.Claude 3.5 Sonnet remains \u201cnotably ahead\u201d in performance.This reaction is interesting becauseAnthropic has the most to losefrom DeepSeek\u2019s success.Why Would Anthropic Downplay DeepSeek?DeepSeek is a direct threat to Claude models by offering similar reasoning capabilities for free.If AI becomes cheaper and open-source, companies won\u2019t need to pay for Claude models.Silicon Valley benefits from the perception that only Western companies can build top-tier AI.Nvidia\u2019s 17% stock drop after DeepSeek\u2019s release suggests investors see it as a real disruption.If DeepSeek werejust a minor efficiency gain, we wouldn\u2019t see such strong pushback.The Geopolitical and Economic Impact of DeepSeek\u2019s SuccessWho Wins?\u2705The Open-Source AI Community\u2013 Developers and researchers now have access to a state-of-the-art reasoning model for free.\u2705Smaller AI Labs and Startups\u2013 Companies no longer need billion-dollar budgets to train or fine-tune competitive models.\u2705Businesses Looking for Affordable AI\u2013 Companies exploring alternatives to OpenAI and Anthropic now have a high-quality open-source option.Who Loses?\u274cAnthropic, OpenAI, and Google\u2013 If DeepSeek\u2019s models gain traction, the business model of paid AI access weakens.\u274cNvidia and Other Hardware Vendors\u2013 If AI models become more efficient, demand for massive GPU clusters could decrease.\u274cSilicon Valley\u2019s AI Monopoly\u2013 This is the first time a Chinese AI company has produced a model competitive with US leaders, raising geopolitical concerns.What Comes Next?\ud83d\udd2e Will OpenAI and Anthropic be forced to open-source more of their models?\ud83d\udd2e Will DeepSeek\u2019s efficiency push accelerate cost reductions across the entire AI industry?\ud83d\udd2e Will regulators step in if DeepSeek gains too much influence?DeepSeek hasalready changed the conversation. Whether this is atrue breakthrough or just another stepin AI\u2019s evolution, one thing is clear:The monopoly of closed-source AI is being challenged like never before.The real question:Will OpenAI and Anthropic adapt\u2014or will they be disrupted?Final Thoughts: Is DeepSeek a Game Changer?A balanced perspective acknowledges that:\u2705DeepSeek\u2019s breakthroughs are real, especially incost efficiency and reasoning improvements.\u2705 Butit\u2019s not the end of OpenAI or Anthropic\u2014yet.\u2705 The biggest shift isin accessibility\u2014DeepSeek has proven thatcutting-edge AI no longer requires billions in funding.TheAI landscape just got a lot more competitive, andthe next few months will determine whether DeepSeek is a true OpenAI rival\u2014or just a temporary shake-up.Citations & ReferencesEmollick\u2019s LinkedIn Post on DeepSeekYouTube Breakdown of DeepSeek\u2019s ReleaseDeepSeek\u2019s Research Paper (arXiv)AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

It enables me to think faster, dig deeper, and deliver more value across teams.But in conversations with peers across engineering, product, and business functions, I\u2019ve noticed something striking: many people hesitate to use AI, even when it could clearly help. It\u2019s not just about technical hurdles like knowing the right prompts or choosing the best tools\u2014though those are challenges, too.The deeper issue is less tangible but much more pervasive: the feeling that using AI somehow undermines the value of our work.In technology and product roles, value is often tied to innovation\u2014creating elegant technical solutions, devising impactful product ideas, or delivering results through effort and expertise. AI changes this dynamic. When used effectively, it can reduce the time spent solving problems or even suggest ideas we might not have considered ourselves. This can leave people wondering: If AI is doing the heavy lifting, what\u2019s my contribution?AI shifts our focus away from routine or time-intensive tasks and toward the creative, strategic, and impactful work that drives progress.This perceived tension between AI\u2019s capabilities and personal value is one of the most significant barriers to adoption I\u2019ve encountered.It\u2019s not about mastering tools; it\u2019s about rethinking how we define professional worth in an AI-driven world.Let's break down both the obvious and non-obvious barriers to AI adoption\u2014especially as they relate to technology and product\u2014and explore how we can reframe AI\u2019s role to unlock its full potential.The obvious challenges to AI adoptionThe initial hype around AI adoption is beginning to cool, as revealed in theFall 2024 Workforce Index by Slack. Despite the widespread awareness of AI's potential, organizations are facing hurdles in turning that awareness into consistent usage. While some individuals and teams integrate AI into their workflows seamlessly, many others struggle with the basics, leading to lower adoption rates.Source: \u201cThe Fall 2024 Workforce Index,\u201d Slack, August 2024.This disparity highlights the gap between understanding AI\u2019s capabilities and effectively leveraging them. Below, we explore the foundational challenges that prevent AI from becoming a universal part of daily workflows.1. You Have to Be Good at PromptingCrafting effective prompts is an iterative skill, much like debugging code or refining a product spec. Poor prompts often lead to irrelevant or unusable outputs, discouraging further experimentation. A study of 5,000 knowledge workers found that only 10% were skilled at prompting. The remaining 90% often receive poor outputs, reinforcing the perception that AI is not worth their time.The Big PictureThe conversational interface, powered by LLMs like ChatGPT, represents a foundational leap in AI\u2019s evolution. Unlike early rule-based chatbots limited by rigid scripts, modern conversational tools offer unprecedented flexibility and interactivity. These interfaces enable users to engage with AI intuitively through everyday language, removing technical barriers and democratizing access to advanced capabilities.By lowering the barrier to entry, today\u2019s AI tools empower both technical and non-technical users to perform complex tasks like data analysis, predictions, and creative brainstorming. This transformation not only streamlines workflows but also sparks new possibilities, making it essential to integrate conversational AI into everyday work.The Path to Unlocking PotentialTo fully harness this potential, teams must learn to craft effective prompts that clearly communicate their goals and needs to the AI. This involves providing specific examples to guide the AI\u2019s response, breaking down complex requests into targeted queries, and iteratively refining prompts based on initial outputs. Developing these skills enables users to unlock AI's flexibility and ensures meaningful, actionable outputs that add value to their workflows.2. You Have to Know When to Use ItUnderstanding which problems are AI-solvable isn\u2019t always intuitive. AI\u2019s capabilities are vast, but applying them effectively requires a clear grasp of its strengths and limitations. Without this understanding, users might either overuse AI for tasks where it adds little value or underuse it for areas where it could significantly improve efficiency and creativity.Key Questions to ConsiderTo determine whether AI is the right tool for a particular task, ask questions like:Should AI be used to debug a code issue?If so, how should it be incorporated\u2014perhaps to identify patterns in logs or suggest possible fixes?Is AI better suited to brainstorm product ideas or conduct market research?It might uncover trends or generate creative directions faster than traditional methods.Can AI add value in generating customer support responses or marketing copy?If yes, how can it align with brand voice and customer expectations?The Role of Specialized ToolsSpecialized tools and vertical AI agents can bridge the gap between raw AI capabilities and specific use cases. For example:IDE Plugins:Assist with code generation, debugging, or refactoring.Roadmap Assistants:Help prioritize features or identify dependencies based on user feedback.Domain-Specific Agents:Tailored solutions for industries like healthcare, legal, or finance, designed to address unique challenges within those fields.While raw conversational AI like ChatGPT offers flexibility, it can feel overwhelming in a blank chat window. Tailored integrations provide structure and guide users toward productive use cases, making it easier to harness AI\u2019s potential effectively.Staying Focused on the ProblemIt\u2019s essential not to lose sight of the original product or business problem that brought you to AI in the first place. Tools and technology are only as valuable as the outcomes they drive. Ensuring that AI solutions remain grounded in real-world needs prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment with organizational goals.3. You Have to Remember to Use ItIt seems counterintuitive\u2014if AI is valuable, why do we sometimes forget to use it? The reality is that integrating any new tool into a workflow requires habit formation. Even early adopters can overlook AI, especially when it\u2019s not yet a natural part of their problem-solving process.Intentionally Incorporating AI into WorkflowsTo make AI a consistent part of your toolkit, integrate it deliberately into daily tasks. Examples include:Sprint Planning:Use AI to brainstorm ideas, prioritize tasks, or identify dependencies.Documentation:Rely on AI to draft and review product documentation or PRDs, saving time and improving clarity.Debugging:Provide AI with log file snippets or error messages to help narrow down issues and suggest potential solutions.These practices not only make AI more accessible but also encourage experimentation, helping teams discover how best to leverage its capabilities.Instead of focusing solely on short-term metrics, the emphasis should be on AI's transformative potential to enhance creativity, efficiency, and decision-making over time.Finding BalanceFor seasoned users, AI often becomes second nature\u2014a go-to resource for many tasks. However, over-reliance can pose its own challenges. There are times when stepping away from AI and solving a problem directly can yield better results, particularly when deep focus or domain expertise is required.The key is balance: use AI to amplify your efforts without letting it replace critical thinking or creativity. Over time, this balanced approach can help AI evolve from an optional tool into an indispensable partner.4. It\u2019s Hard to Measure AI ROIQuantifying the value AI provides remains a significant challenge for teams. How do you measure the time saved, the quality of outputs, or the broader impact of AI on decision-making? Without clear metrics, it's difficult to justify the investment of time and resources into adopting AI tools.Challenges in Measuring AI ROI1. Time Saved vs. Quality GainedWhile AI can automate repetitive tasks, its true value often lies in improving the quality of work. For example, AI might help generate more creative ideas or uncover insights in data that humans might miss. These qualitative benefits are harder to measure than simple time savings.2. Subjectivity in Perceived ValueDifferent teams may value AI contributions differently. Engineers might focus on debugging speed, while marketing teams prioritize creative outputs. The subjective nature of value can lead to inconsistent ROI measurement across departments.3. Cost of Integration and TrainingThe upfront investment in training teams to use AI tools and integrating these tools into existing workflows can overshadow immediate benefits, making it harder to demonstrate short-term ROI.Strategies to Demonstrate AI ROI1. Define Key Metrics EarlyIdentify what success looks like before integrating AI. Examples include:Reducing time spent on specific tasks (e.g., documentation, debugging).Increasing the number of creative solutions generated during brainstorming sessions.Improving accuracy in repetitive processes like data entry or analysis.2. Use Comparative StudiesTest the same task with and without AI to measure differences in time, quality, or output. For instance:How much faster can a team generate a technical document using AI for summarization?Does AI-assisted code debugging result in fewer bugs in production?3. Log and Analyze Outputs Over TimeCreate a repository of AI outputs and track how they influence decisions or lead to successful outcomes. Examples include:An AI-generated idea that became a key feature in a product.Customer support templates created by AI that led to higher satisfaction scores.4. Monitor Team Feedback and Adoption RatesUse surveys or discussions to gauge how teams feel about AI's impact on their workflows. Higher adoption rates often correlate with perceived value, even if it\u2019s not directly measurable.The Long-Term ViewAI's value may not always be immediately apparent. In many cases, benefits compound over time as teams refine how they use the tools and integrate them more seamlessly into their workflows.This shift to an AI-augmented workflow is comparable to the adoption of DevOps practices or automation in software testing\u2014initial resistance and costs eventually give way to measurable productivity gains and improved outcomes.By embracing a mindset of continuous experimentation and improvement, teams can build a case for AI that transcends traditional ROI models. Instead of focusing solely on short-term metrics, the emphasis should be on AI's transformative potential to enhance creativity, efficiency, and decision-making over time.5. Concerns About Accuracy and TrustAI isn\u2019t always reliable. Its outputs can be inaccurate, incomplete, or biased\u2014often referred to as \"hallucinations.\" These inaccuracies can erode trust, particularly in high-stakes applications like financial analysis, medical diagnostics, or technical decision-making. Ensuring that AI outputs are valid, actionable, and aligned with user needs requires significant oversight.The Role of ValidationValidation is critical for building trust in AI outputs:Technical Validation:Engineers must assess the technical correctness of outputs, especially in areas like code generation or system design, where errors could lead to downstream issues.Alignment with User Needs:Product teams or stakeholders should evaluate whether the outputs meet user expectations and align with intended outcomes or experiences.Interestingly, AI \"hallucinations\" can sometimes be reframed as opportunities for creative exploration. Unexpected or unconventional outputs might spark new ideas or reveal alternative approaches that traditional workflows wouldn\u2019t generate.Skill HighlightEffective AI usage mirrors traditional problem-solving skills:Decompose Challenges:Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components.Iterative Refinement:Continuously refine AI outputs to focus on actionable results.Combine Expertise with AI:Use domain knowledge to validate and contextualize AI suggestions, ensuring outputs are both relevant and practical.These skills are already second nature to experienced engineers and product managers, making them well-equipped to collaborate effectively with AI.The Path ForwardBuilding trust with AI requires a strategic, iterative approach:Start Broad:Use general prompts to explore potential solutions or generate ideas.Refine the Focus:Narrow down the scope to specific aspects of the problem, validating the outputs as you progress.Iterate and Adjust:Continuously refine, test, and contextualize outputs, treating AI as a collaborative partner rather than an infallible authority.This mindset encourages confidence in AI\u2019s capabilities while fostering a collaborative dynamic. Over time, AI becomes a reliable asset for creativity, problem-solving, and decision-making, unlocking its full potential across a range of applications.The non-obvious challenges to AI adoption1. The Value of Original IdeasOriginality is often considered a cornerstone of professional value, especially in tech and product roles. However, ideas generated by AI may feel less valuable simply because they didn\u2019t originate entirely from the individual. This can lead users to downplay or dismiss the contributions AI can bring.Reframing the Narrative:AI should be viewed as a brainstorming partner that expands creative bandwidth, not a competitor for credit. It enhances originality by providing starting points, uncovering blind spots, and suggesting directions that might not have been considered otherwise.The Tool, Not the Creator:Just as computers replaced paper as tools for creation, AI empowers users to work faster and explore ideas more deeply. The partnership between human creativity and AI-generated insights often leads to truly innovative solutions.2. The Value of EffortHard work is deeply ingrained in our sense of professional worth. When AI reduces the amount of effort required, it can feel like cutting corners. This misconception can foster resistance, as people equate effort with value rather than focusing on outcomes.Reframing Effort as Optimization:Effort should focus on optimizing processes and addressing high-value challenges. Just as automation tools freed engineers from repetitive tasks, AI allows teams to spend less time on execution and more on strategy, design, and systems-level thinking.Evolving Knowledge Work:AI elevates knowledge work by enabling faster exploration of abstract concepts and narrowing the landscape of possibilities during problem-solving. This evolution mirrors the broader advancement of technology\u2014freeing us from manual labor to focus on creative and intellectual pursuits.3. Bias Toward PerfectionAI outputs are often imperfect, which can frustrate users. This frustration stems from two assumptions:AI should be perfect because it\u2019s a computer.If AI creates more space for exploration, the output must be perfected.Treat AI as a Junior Collaborator:AI is not a magic wand; it\u2019s more like a junior team member providing rough drafts that require iteration and refinement. Just as you wouldn\u2019t expect perfection from an intern, AI\u2019s outputs are starting points, not finished products.Balancing Exploration and Execution:While AI opens the door to abstract thinking, it\u2019s essential to set boundaries for iteration. Instead of seeking perfection, focus on outputs that meet project goals and move the work forward. Often, imperfection sparks innovation, as unexpected results can lead to new ideas.4. Interdisciplinary MisalignmentAI is often perceived differently across disciplines, leading to conflicting expectations. For example, engineers might emphasize technical feasibility\u2014whether AI can execute a task efficiently and reliably\u2014while product teams may focus on outcomes, such as user satisfaction or business impact. This divergence can create inefficiencies and misaligned priorities, slowing AI adoption.Root Cause:The misalignment often stems from differences in how teams approach problem-solving:Engineers typically break down tasks into discrete, solvable units, focusing on \"how\" the solution works.Product teams prioritize the \"why\"\u2014the overarching goals, user experience, and broader market needs.A Practical Approach to Bridging the Gap:Define Clear Objectives Together:Begin AI projects with cross-functional discussions to align on goals, ensuring technical feasibility and user outcomes are equally prioritized.Collaborate on AI Use Cases:Involve both technical and non-technical teams in selecting and shaping AI applications, from initial concept to implementation.Establish Shared Metrics:Develop success metrics that resonate with all stakeholders, such as reducing user friction (product focus) while maintaining reliability (engineering focus).Moving Toward Unified AI Adoption:The misalignment between disciplines won\u2019t disappear overnight, but creating opportunities for collaboration can significantly reduce friction. Teams that align on goals, communicate effectively, and foster shared accountability are better positioned to leverage AI\u2019s potential and integrate it seamlessly into workflows.How to make this mindset shift1. Realize That Leadership Values Results Over ProcessesLeaders prioritize results and impact over the specific processes used to achieve them. Whether ideas come from AI or traditional brainstorming, what matters most is the value they deliver. Embracing AI as part of your workflow doesn\u2019t undermine your contribution\u2014it amplifies it by enabling better outcomes more efficiently.2. Start with Something Small to Reduce FrictionOne of the biggest hurdles to adopting AI is simply getting started. Begin by applying AI to low-stakes or exploratory tasks where perfection isn\u2019t critical. For instance, use AI to draft initial concepts, brainstorm ideas, or summarize complex information. Starting small builds familiarity and confidence, making it easier to integrate AI into more impactful areas over time.3. Pair AI with Human ExpertiseThink of AI as a teammate that extends your capabilities, not as a replacement. AI excels at generating options, uncovering patterns, or summarizing information, but the final decisions and insights remain yours. Combining AI\u2019s speed and breadth with your unique context and judgment creates a partnership where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.4. Celebrate Small WinsTrack and share successes from using AI\u2014whether it\u2019s saving time, generating a unique idea, or solving a problem faster. Small wins reinforce the value of AI, build trust in its capabilities, and encourage others to experiment with it in their own workflows.5. Normalize AI as a UtilityAI should be viewed as a foundational tool, much like electricity or running water\u2014a resource that enables higher-value work by handling routine or time-intensive tasks. The more seamlessly AI integrates into daily workflows, the more it frees up mental and creative energy for tackling complex challenges and driving innovation.ConclusionLet\u2019s all agree: using AI is not cheating. It\u2019s a productivity optimization tool, much like automation revolutionized manufacturing or software frameworks streamlined application development. These tools didn\u2019t replace human ingenuity\u2014they amplified it, freeing us to focus on higher-order challenges.By partnering with AI, we don\u2019t lose our value; we expand it. AI shifts our energy from routine tasks to creativity, strategy, and impact\u2014the work that defines success in today\u2019s world. Together with AI, we can redefine how we work, solve problems, and innovate. The future of work isn\u2019t about replacement\u2014it\u2019s about collaboration.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder. Juniors aren\u2019t learning, orgs lose future leaders, and inequality grows.

Building on Beowulf clusters and Charm++, they face challenges like routing and aggregation, requiring smarter systems, semantic routing, and dynamic workflows for the future.Travis FrisingerDec 16, 2024\u20225 min readDistributed computing has come a long way since my early days in the industry, whenBeowulf clustersandCharm++were the state of the art. Long before theXen Hypervisorand thecloud revolutionsimplified everything, managing computational workloads across nodes required significant effort, ingenuity, and a healthy tolerance for complexity.Back then, distributed systems solved computation-heavy problems by efficiently sharing workloads across multiple nodes. Today, the rise of AI agents brings a new kind of distributed system\u2014one where intelligence, not just computation, is distributed among collaborative, task-specific agents. These agents collaborate to tackle problems no single system could solve on its own.While the tools and goals have evolved, the core challenges\u2014efficient routing, aggregation, and fault tolerance\u2014remain strikingly familiar. Inspired byBerkeley Artificial Intelligence Research\u2019s (BAIR)recent exploration into Compound AI systems andmy own workwith distributed computing frameworks in the early 2000s, let\u2019s dive into how AI agents are transforming distributed computing and why this new frontier demands innovative solutions.Despite advances in cloud-native systems, AI agents reintroduce classic distributed computing challenges, now infused with AI-specific complexities.What Are AI Agents?Imagine running a company with a team of specialists: a marketing expert, a financial analyst, a designer, and a project manager. Each team member excels in their domain, but it\u2019s the manager who delegates tasks, coordinates efforts, and ensures they\u2019re working toward a common goal. AI agents work in much the same way.In distributed AI systems, these agents are typically task-specific software built around a combination of prompts, a large language model (LLM), and one or more tools. Each agent is designed to perform a specialized function\u2014such as reasoning, perception, language understanding, or decision-making. Working together under the guidance of a coordinating system, these agents collaborate to produce a unified and cohesive result.In essence,AI agentsform the building blocks of modern distributed systems, designed to:Decompose complex problemsinto subtasks handled by specialized agents.Route and aggregate requestsefficiently between agents.Adapt workflows dynamically, assigning tasks to agents based on predefined performance metrics or iterative improvements.A Parallel to Early Distributed ComputingFor those of us who rememberBeowulf clustersand frameworks likeCharm++, the similarities are striking:Beowulf: Revolutionized distributed computing by enabling affordable clusters of commodity hardware. Tasks were divided and conquered, with a focus on high-performance, parallel processing.Charm++: Pioneered the idea ofintelligent task scheduling, where objects could migrate between processors to balance workloads dynamically.Similarly, modern distributed AI systems aim to:Break down workflows into modular, parallelizable components (agents).Dynamically route tasks between agents based on performance and specialization.Balance computational efficiency with the quality of results.Yet, where Beowulf and Charm++ handled deterministic workloads, AI agents must navigate theuncertaintyinherent in machine learning\u2014a fundamentally more challenging landscape.Real-World Applications of AI AgentsTo understand the potential of AI agents, let\u2019s explore some examples already shaping industries:AutoGPT and Agent-based Systems:Tools like AutoGPT illustrate early-stage implementations of AI agents, where models break down tasks and collaborate to combine outputs. While promising, these systems are experimental and lack the robustness of fully integrated multi-agent systems. For example, a travel-planning agent might generate itineraries, another estimate costs, and a third refine the final plan.AI-Driven E-Commerce:In platforms like Amazon, modular AI systems handle tasks such as product recommendations, fraud detection, and inventory updates. While these systems are tightly integrated microservices rather than independent AI agents, they demonstrate the potential of modular workflows driven by task-specific AI components.Multimodal AI Applications:Applications like ChatGPT Vision or Adobe Firefly showcase multimodal processing, where specialized modules handle vision and language tasks. These are foundational steps toward building systems with multiple agents that work independently yet harmoniously.Revisiting the Core Challenges of Distributed ComputingDespite advances in cloud-native systems, AI agents reintroduce classic distributed computing challenges, now infused with AI-specific complexities:Routing RequestsThen: Load balancers directed tasks to nodes in a Beowulf cluster.Now: Requests must be intelligently routed between AI agents, each with unique capabilities and performance profiles.Future Need: Reinforcement learning algorithms to dynamically optimize routing based on agent performance.Result AggregationThen: Systems like MapReduce excelled at combining results from distributed nodes.Now: Distributed AI systems must merge probabilistic and incomplete outputs (e.g., combining text summaries and visual data).Future Need: Semantically-aware aggregation mechanisms for reconciling conflicting outputs.Dynamic OrchestrationThen: Charm++ enabled tasks to migrate dynamically to balance workloads.Now: AI systems must adapt workflows in real time, rerouting tasks or revisiting outputs based on partial results.Future Need: Middleware frameworks to coordinate and manage dynamic workflows for AI agents.Fault ToleranceThen: Redundancy and failover strategies ensured robustness.Now: AI systems must recover from subtle errors, like biased or incorrect outputs from agents.Future Need: Self-healing mechanisms where agents validate and correct one another\u2019s work.From Microservices to AI Agents: The Cloud-Native ConnectionThe cloud-native era transformed distributed computing by introducing tools like Kubernetes, which standardized deployment, scaling, and fault tolerance for microservices. These advances abstracted much of the complexity engineers faced with earlier systems like Beowulf and Charm++. Microservices allowed developers to break down monolithic applications into modular, independent services that could scale dynamically.However,AI agents go beyond microservices, addressing challenges that cloud-native tools were never designed to solve:Contextual Routing: Microservices rely on predefined rules for routing requests, but AI agents require intelligent, context-aware decision-making to assign tasks to the best-suited agent.Adaptive Workflows: While microservices follow linear, static workflows, AI agents collaborate dynamically, adjusting workflows in real-time based on intermediate results or changing goals.Collaborative Learning: Unlike microservices, which perform isolated functions, AI agents have the potential to share knowledge and learn from each other, improving system-wide performance over time.AI agents represent a smarter evolution of distributed computing\u2014where intelligence, not just tasks, is distributed across systems. They build on the foundation of cloud-native tools like Kubernetes but extend their capabilities to handle the dynamic, uncertain, and learning-oriented workflows that define the future of AI-driven systems.Looking Ahead: Distributed IntelligenceAI agents represent a shift from distributingcomputationto distributingintelligence. But this evolution comes with challenges that will define the next decade:Semantic Routing: Systems that understand tasks well enough to route them intelligently.Collaborative Agents: Mechanisms for agents to share insights while respecting data privacy.Middleware for Agents: Robust frameworks to manage agent workflows, akin to Kubernetes for microservices.Edge Intelligence: Moving decision-making closer to users to improve latency and efficiency.Conclusion: A New Frontier, Familiar ProblemsAs someone who recalls debugging Beowulf clusters and experimenting with Charm++, it\u2019s fascinating to see how distributed computing principles are re-emerging in the context of AI. Multi-agent AI systems are complex, messy, and rife with potential\u2014but they\u2019re also a reminder that the foundations we laid in distributed computing still matter.The future of AI isn\u2019t just about bigger models; it\u2019s about smarter systems. And as we tackle these challenges, we\u2019re not so much reinventing the wheel as refining it for a new era.I leave you with this thought: If Beowulf was the DIY revolution of distributed computing, and Kubernetes redefined simplicity in the cloud-native era, what will emerge to shape and define the era of AI agents?AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

Aligning AI UX and engineering creates practical, trustworthy, and transformative solutions for everyday workflows.Travis FrisingerNov 21, 2024\u20226 min readArtificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming technology, making it indispensable in everyday workflows. Yet, building AI products isn\u2019t just about technical robustness\u2014it\u2019s about creating exceptional user experiences (UX) that seamlessly integrate AI into tools people rely on daily. The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) highlights a critical challenge: how do we align engineering excellence with user-centric design to create trustworthy, adaptable, and impactful systems?Reflecting on my experiences with distributed systems and data engineering, I came across aLatent Spacearticle introducing the3 Ps of AI UX Design\u2014Presence, Practicality, and Power.These principles resonate deeply with the3 Ps of AI Engineering\u2014Providers, Provenance, and Polyglot,which I\u2019ve developed over years of solving data challenges. Together, these frameworks provide a comprehensive roadmap for creating AI systems that are technically robust, user-focused, and built to last.AI should feel like a utility, not a feature\u2014seamlessly integrated, always present, and ready to assistThe 3 Ps of AI UX Design1. PresencePresence is about making AI a seamless part of the user\u2019s workflow. It should feel like a natural extension of their tools, reducing friction and enabling intuitive adoption. For instance:Code autocomplete tools in IDEs like Copilot or Cursor embed AI directly into the developer\u2019s environment.AI-enhanced writing assistants, such as Grammarly, integrate within email clients and browsers.The goal is clear: users shouldn\u2019t have to think of AI as a separate tool\u2014it should simply exist, seamlessly integrated, and ready to assist. AI should function more like a utility than a standalone feature, much like infrastructure operates as a cloud utility.2. PracticalityPracticality ensures that AI solves real problems. Features must deliver tangible value and address specific pain points rather than feeling like mere gimmicks. Examples include:Summarizing long emails or documents for professionals.Helping marketers generate tailored, effective ad copy.Practical AI UX requires an understanding of the user\u2019s daily challenges and designing solutions that fit seamlessly into their workflows.3. PowerPower highlights the transformative potential of AI. It\u2019s about enabling users to accomplish tasks that were previously difficult or impossible. Think of:An AI-powered legal assistant that extracts case law from hundreds of documents in seconds.A creative AI that generates unique art or music, providing users with tools to explore ideas and concepts, unlocking new avenues for creativity they never had before.When AI demonstrates its power, it becomes a compelling reason for users to adopt the product.The 3 Ps of AI EngineeringComplementing UX design, the3 Ps of AI Engineeringaddress the technical backbone that supports AI products.1. ProvidersProviders are the data sources and infrastructures that fuel AI systems. They supply high-quality, diverse datasets essential for model training, fine-tuning, and real-time operations. Reliable providers ensure the accuracy, relevance, and robustness of AI applications, forming the foundation for impactful workflows.For instance:Public datasets likeCommon Crawlare critical for training language models.Proprietary sources like Bloomberg provide curated financial data for industry-specific AI tools.Real-time integrations with platforms like e-commerce APIs for product availability or geolocation APIs for traffic patterns enable AI systems to provide actionable, contextually relevant insights.The goal is clear: without reliable data providers, AI systems cannot deliver consistent and meaningful results.2. ProvenanceProvenance establishes trust in AI systems by clearly linking outputs to their source data and detailing the processes behind their generation. It is essential for transparency, accountability, and compliance, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and legal systems.For example:In healthcare, an AI tool recommending treatments should reference the clinical guidelines or patient data it relied on, enabling practitioners to validate its decisions.In financial analysis, provenance ensures that market predictions are traceable to reliable stock data or historical trends.In AI-generated content, source verification helps mitigate risks of misinformation, allowing users to confidently rely on outputs.By embedding provenance into workflows, organizations can ensure credibility and foster user confidence.3. PolyglotPolyglot engineering enables AI systems to seamlessly interact with diverse data sources, formats, and languages, making them adaptable across industries and use cases. This versatility allows AI to handle structured and unstructured data while delivering tailored insights.For instance:An AI system that translates product descriptions across multiple languages while accounting for cultural nuances, enabling personalized shopping experiences for international customers.Tools like Snowflake enable AI systems to unify data from cloud warehouses, relational databases, and real-time streams, driving advanced analytics and scalable insights.Platforms like Descript streamline video production by transcribing audio, detecting speakers, and extracting metadata. Creators can edit videos using transcribed text and generate automatic overlays, enabling quick uploads to platforms like YouTube Shorts or TikTok.The objective is flexibility: AI systems should operate smoothly in dynamic environments, ensuring interoperability and scalability.Bridging the Gap: Synergy Between UX and EngineeringThe3 Ps of AI UXand3 Ps of AI Engineeringare complementary, with each set of principles reinforcing the other to create impactful, user-friendly AI products. Let\u2019s expand on this synergy with more tangible examples:Presence Needs ProvidersTo achieve seamless Presence in UX, engineering must prioritize reliable Providers.

However, as we push RAG systems from POC (Proof of Concept) to production, challenges such as data integration, synchronization, and scalability issues emerge, potentially undermining performance and reliability. Addressing these obstacles requires a strong data foundation, structured around three essential pillars: Providers, Provenance, and Polyglot Persistence\u2014collectively known as the 3 Ps.Each of these principles plays a unique role in transforming RAG systems from promising POCs into resilient, production-grade solutions:Providersbring diverse data sources - structured, semi-structured, and unstructured - to fuel AI responses, ensuring relevance and depth as new sources are added.Provenancetracks data lineage and transformations, establishing data integrity, trust, and adaptability as requirements grow.Polyglot Persistenceoptimizes data storage across multiple database types, enabling efficient and relevant data retrieval that scales with complexity.Building RAG Systems: The 3 Ps of AI Engineering \u2013 Providers, Provenance, and PolyglotIn this blog, we\u2019ll explore each of these pillars, examining the tools that support them, where custom solutions are typically required, and practical tips for building a robust, scalable RAG system. By understanding and leveraging the 3 Ps, engineers can create AI solutions that transition seamlessly from POC to production, delivering high-quality, contextually rich responses at scale.1. Providers: The Source of Diverse DataProvidersare the entry points for data, supplying the diverse information that fuels an AI system. For RAG systems, where diversity and updates are critical, Providers encompass structured data like databases, semi-structured data like PDFs and PowerPoint presentations, and unstructured data like customer reviews or social media posts. Without a robust network of Providers, an AI system risks delivering limited or outdated responses, reducing its value to users.Example in PracticeConsider a knowledge management system for a large enterprise aiming to assist employees in finding information quickly. The AI system might draw on:Structured Data:Databases: Employee records, project timelines, and organizational charts.Semi-Structured Data:PDFs: Policy documents, compliance guidelines, and training manuals.PowerPoint Presentations: Recent sales pitches, strategic plans, and quarterly reviews.Unstructured Data:Customer Reviews: Feedback from various platforms providing insights into product performance.Emails and Chat Logs: Internal communications that can shed light on project statuses or commonly faced issues.When an employee asks, \"What's the current policy on remote work?\" the system can:Retrieve the latestPDFpolicy document.Reference any recentPowerPointpresentations from HR about policy changes.Pull in relevantcustomer reviewsthat might have influenced policy adjustments.By integrating data from these diverse Providers, the AI system offers a comprehensive, accurate, and context-rich response.Existing SolutionsMany tools can simplify Provider integration, especially for handling different data types:ETL Platforms:Apache NiFi: For building and managing complex data flows, including semi-structured data.Airbyte,Fivetran, andStitch: For connecting APIs, databases, and third-party data providers.Document Processing Tools:Unstructured: For extracting text and metadata from various document formats like PDFs and PowerPoint presentations. It excels at processing unstructured and semi-structured data, making it ideal for integrating diverse documents into your RAG system.Textract(AWS) orAzure AI Document Intelligence: For extracting structured information from documents.These tools offer connectors and processors for various data sources, serving as a base layer for data ingestion.Where Custom Work Is NeededWhile existing tools handle standard formats, custom integration may be required for:Complex Documents: Parsing specialized or proprietary formats.Real-Time Data: Ingesting unstructured data like live customer reviews or social media feeds.Data Freshness and Consistency: Ensuring the most recent versions of documents are used, especially when multiple versions exist.Custom ETL pipelines might be necessary to handle:Version Control: Managing different versions of semi-structured documents.Metadata Extraction: Pulling out specific fields or annotations from documents.Content Categorization: Classifying unstructured data into meaningful categories for retrieval.Practical TipUse ETL tools for standard Providers and build modular ingestion pipelines for specialized or real-time data sources. \"Utilize document processing libraries likeUnstructuredto extract content from PDFs and PowerPoint presentations.Consider leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques for unstructured datalike customer reviews to extract valuable insights such as sentiment, key themes, and customer intents.Sentiment Analysis: Use NLP models to determine whether a review expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This helps your AI system understand overall customer satisfaction and prioritize responses to negative feedback.Topic Modeling: Apply techniques likeLatent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) or transformer-based models to identify common themes within the reviews. This aids in categorizing feedback and identifying prevalent issues or features that customers frequently mention.Entity Recognition: UtilizeNamed Entity Recognition(NER) to extract specific entities such as product names, services, or specific issues mentioned in the reviews. This enables more precise responses and better routing of information within your system.Tools and Libraries:Sentiment Analysis:VADER Sentiment Analyzer: A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is effective on social media and customer review texts.TextBlob: A simple library for processing textual data, which includes a built-in sentiment analysis module.Hugging Face Transformers: Provides access to pre-trained transformer models likeBERTorRoBERTafor more nuanced sentiment analysis.Topic Modeling:Gensim: An open-source library for unsupervised topic modeling and natural language processing, supporting algorithms like LDA and LSI.Entity Recognition:spaCy: A powerful library for advanced NLP tasks, including efficient and accurate named entity recognition.Flair: An easy-to-use NLP library built on PyTorch, offering state-of-the-art NER models.Hugging Face Transformers: Utilize transformer models fine-tuned for NER tasks.By processing unstructured data with these NLP techniques and tools, you enrich your AI system's understanding of customer feedback, enabling it to deliver more accurate and context-aware responses. This not only improves user satisfaction but also provides valuable insights for continuous improvement of your products or services.Designing your system with a flexible architecture will make it easier to integrate new Providers as they become relevant and maintain the agility needed for real-time responses.2. Provenance: The Lifeline of Data IntegritySourcing data alone isn\u2019t enough\u2014tracking the history and transformations of this data is whereProvenancecomes into play. Provenance ensures data traceability, documenting every transformation from raw input to output. In AI engineering, particularly for RAG systems handling varied data types, Provenance is critical to ensure data integrity, accountability, and transparency. It enables engineers to trace any decision back to the data sources that informed it, making it easier to adapt when data changes.Example in PracticeImagine an AI-driven legal assistant used by a law firm, integrating data from multiple sources:Structured Data:Case Management Systems: Details about ongoing and past cases.Semi-Structured Data:Legal Documents in PDFs: Contracts, court filings, and legal briefs.PowerPoint Presentations: Summaries of case strategies or legal precedents.Unstructured Data:Client Emails: Communications that may impact legal strategies.Provenance allows for key info to be tracked:Document Versions: Knowing which version of a contract was used in forming a legal argument.Source Attribution: Identifying which court filing influenced a recommendation.Transformation Steps: Recording how a PDF was parsed and which NLP techniques were applied to extract information.If a legal recommendation changes due to an updated court ruling, Provenance enables lawyers to trace this change back to the specific document and even the exact passage that caused the shift, ensuring accountability and compliance with legal standards.Existing SolutionsSeveral metadata management and data lineage tools support Provenance tracking:OpenLineage: Designed for collecting and integrating lineage data across tools, OpenLineage is a metadata standard supported by various platforms like Airflow, dbt, and Spark.

For critical data requiring high accountability, implement custom logging during data transformations, especially for semi-structured or unstructured data. Use unique identifiers for documents and their extracted content to maintain traceability across systems. This balances the ease of these solutions with the precision needed for strict Provenance.3. Polyglot Persistence: Building Data FlexibilitySourcing and tracking data are foundational steps, but storing it in the most effective way for fast retrieval is equally essential.Polyglot Persistenceinvolves using multiple database types to store data based on its structure, retrieval needs, and usage patterns. For complex, diverse data in RAG systems, Polyglot Persistence offers the flexibility to store and retrieve information efficiently, enhancing performance and response relevance.Reframing Embeddings as Derived DataOne key insight is to treat embeddings not as standalone data points but as derived data\u2014high-dimensional representations created directly from source data like text from PDFs, slides from PowerPoint presentations, or sentences from customer reviews. By viewing embeddings as derived data, you can streamline their management and respond more flexibly to updates in the source data. This approach allows for targeted synchronization when source data changes, rather than requiring constant bulk update synchronizations, ultimately improving responsiveness and reducing maintenance overhead.Automatic Synchronization with Database-Integrated VectorizersRecent developments include database-integrated vectorizers. By using SaaS solutions that integrate vectorization capabilities, such asWeaviateorZilliz Cloud, AI engineers can achieve automatic synchronization of embeddings with source data, freeing up resources otherwise spent on synchronization tasks.RAG System Integration Flow: Structured to Unstructured Data TransformationExample in PracticeConsider an AI-powered customer support system that needs to provide instant, accurate responses by accessing:Structured Data:CRM Systems: Customer profiles and interaction histories.Semi-Structured Data:Knowledge Base Articles in PDFs: Product manuals and troubleshooting guides.Training Materials in PowerPoints: Internal staff training slides that might contain useful information.Unstructured Data:Customer Reviews and Feedback: Insights into common issues and sentiments.Using Polyglot Persistence, this system stores each data type in its optimal database: relational for structured data, document stores for PDFs and presentations, NoSQL for unstructured feedback, and vector databases for embeddings. Data integration and virtualization tools ensure seamless access and synchronization across all databases.When a customer asks, \"How can I reset my device's firmware?\" the system can:Retrieve relevant PDF sections from the product manual stored inMongoDB Atlas.Reference PowerPoint slides from training materials indexed inElastic Cloud.Use embeddings stored inPineconeto semantically match the query with both structured and unstructured data, providing a comprehensive answer.Where Custom Work Is NeededWhile these services support storage, Polyglot Persistence introduces complexity around:Data Synchronization: Ensuring updates in semi-structured documents are reflected across all relevant databases.Cross-Database Queries: Enabling seamless queries that span structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.Optimization: Custom indexing and caching strategies to improve retrieval times.Custom work might involve:Implementing Data Synchronization Mechanisms: Using SaaS integration tools or custom scripts to keep data consistent across databases.Setting Up Data Virtualization Layers: Using a platform to provide unified access and querying capabilities.Optimizing Queries and Indexing: Tailoring strategies to your specific data and access patterns for improved performance.Practical TipLeverage SaaS Database Solutions for Simplicity and Scalability:Utilize databases likeMongoDB Atlas,Elastic Cloud, andPineconeto handle different data types without the need to manage infrastructure.Data integration tools likeFivetranorStitchcan be used to automate data synchronization between systems.Implement Unified Data Access with SaaS Data Virtualization Platforms:Consider a platform likePrestoorDremio Cloudto create a virtualized data layer. This allows you to query across multiple data sources with a single interface, simplifying data access and reducing the need for complex data movement.Automate Data Workflows and Synchronization:Use workflow orchestration tools likePrefect CloudorAstronomer(managed Apache Airflow) to schedule and manage data pipelines and synchronization tasks.By leveraging SaaS products, you reduce the operational overhead and complexity associated with managing multiple database systems. This approach enables small teams to implement robust Polyglot Persistence strategies, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval across diverse data types.By understanding and leveraging the 3 Ps, engineers can create AI solutions that transition seamlessly from POC to production, delivering high-quality, contextually rich responses at scalePermissions and Regulatory Compliance: Managing Data Access and PrivacyIn RAG systems, managingPermissionsandRegulatory Complianceis essential for secure, compliant data usage, especially when working with sensitive or regulated data across various formats. Permissions control access levels across datasets, ensuring that only authorized users or systems can access, modify, or retrieve data from Providers. Compliance requirements (such as GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific regulations) often demand data segmentation, audit trails, and secure storage.Best Practices for Permissions and ComplianceImplement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):Define roles and permissionsbased on job functions, limiting access to only the necessary data.Example: Only legal team members can access certain confidential PDFs or PowerPoint presentations.Solutions:Keycloak: An open-source identity and access management tool that provides RBAC, single sign-on (SSO), and integrations with LDAP.Okta: Provides identity management with robust RBAC features.Auth0: Offers authentication and authorization services with fine-grained access control.Azure Entra ID: Includes RBAC capabilities for managing access to cloud resources.Utilize Data Masking and Anonymization:Protect sensitive databy masking identifiable information while still allowing it to be used in RAG responses when needed.Example: Anonymize customer reviews to protect personal information.Solutions:Aircloak: An open-source project from the OpenMined community that provides differential privacy for data anonymization, helping mask sensitive data fields.Protegrity: Offers data protection solutions, including data masking and tokenization.BigID: Provides data discovery and masking for sensitive data across various sources.Informatica Cloud Data Masking: Enables dynamic data masking and anonymization in the cloud.Automate Auditing with Provenance:Track and log every accessand data transformation, providing a clear audit trail.Benefit: Provenance aids in identifying and addressing compliance risks by maintaining a historical record of data usage.Maintain Region-Specific Data Segmentation:Ensure data storage complieswith regional regulations, such as storing EU customer data within Europe for GDPR compliance.Leverage data governance tools to manage permissions and auditing across different data types and storage solutions effectively:Identity and Access Management (IAM): Implement centralized IAM for role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) across applications and data sources, ensuring consistent access controls and user management.Data Governance Platforms: Utilize data governance solutions to manage data catalogs, lineage, and compliance in a unified platform, helping to track data usage, transformations, and ownership.Regular Compliance Protocol Updates: Keep compliance protocols up to date with evolving regulations to maintain data protection and audit-readiness. Robust Provenance tracking is essential for providing clear audit trails and compliance transparency.By utilizing these governance and IAM strategies, you can simplify permissions and compliance management, reduce operational overhead, and maintain focus on building secure, scalable RAG systems.Bridging the Gap from POC to Production with the 3 PsMoving a RAG system from POC to production involves addressing scalability, reliability, and data integrity challenges that aren\u2019t always apparent during the initial development phase. This transition is where the 3 Ps\u2014Providers, Provenance, and Polyglot Persistence\u2014prove their value, offering robust solutions to common obstacles encountered when scaling up.Here\u2019s how each principle plays a critical role in bridging that gap:Providers: Ensuring Data Depth and RelevanceChallenge in POC to Production: In a POC, integrating only a few data sources can showcase system potential. But in production, maintaining relevance requires a broader set of data sources.How Providers Help: A robust network of Providers ensures the system can pull timely, diverse data to handle various scenarios in production, adapting flexibly as new data sources become available.Provenance: Creating Trust and ConsistencyChallenge in POC to Production: During a POC, shortcuts and limited data history are often acceptable. Production systems, however, require traceable, reliable data to ensure trust and regulatory compliance.How Provenance Helps: Provenance provides data traceability and adaptability. It allows engineers to trace each decision back to its data origin, making it easier to identify issues, meet compliance standards, and maintain data integrity over time.Polyglot Persistence: Maintaining Performance and FlexibilityChallenge in POC to Production: A POC may work with a single database, but production demands often require optimized storage solutions for diverse data types.How Polyglot Persistence Helps: Polyglot Persistence enables engineers to store each data type in the optimal database, preventing performance bottlenecks and ensuring flexibility. This approach allows the system to adapt and expand its capabilities smoothly as new data requirements emerge.The 3 Ps provide a powerful framework for transforming an RAG system from an experimental POC into a reliable, adaptable, and high-performing production system.ConclusionFor AI engineers,Providers,Provenance, andPolyglot Persistencerepresent a transformative approach to data management in RAG systems dealing with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. By understanding the role of each principle and leveraging a mix of existing tools and custom solutions, engineers can create AI systems that are adaptable, transparent, and efficient.While many tools can help implement the 3 Ps, custom engineering is often necessary to fully realize these capabilities. Consider how these principles could elevate your own projects, bringing agility, traceability, and optimized retrieval to every interaction. By combining out-of-the-box solutions with tailored enhancements, engineers can build RAG systems that are ready to meet the demands of dynamic, context-rich AI\u2014ultimately delivering more valuable, relevant, and responsive user experiences.Source:Vector Databases Are the Wrong AbstractionAI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

Explore the unique roles of AI-powered code assistants, conversational tools, and more, and discover why the design and integration of these tools are key to the future of work.Travis FrisingerNov 13, 2024\u20226 min readAI tools are transforming how software is built, with GitHub Copilot at the forefront of this quiet revolution in coding efficiency and team dynamics. A recent working paper from Harvard Business School,Generative AI and the Nature of Work,dives into how these tools reshape workflows, focusing on Copilot\u2019s profound impact on task allocation, productivity, and collaboration.This isn\u2019t just about one tool\u2014it\u2019s about understanding how generative AI is changing the nature of work itself. The findings prompt a bigger question: Are these changes unique to Copilot, or do they reflect a broader shift that depends on the design and purpose of different AI tools?The Copilot Case Study: Key FindingsThe study provides compelling insights into how GitHub Copilot impacts software development workflows. By analyzing millions of work activities over two years, researchers identified four key trends:1. Focus on Core Coding TasksDevelopers using Copilot spent significantly more time writing code and less time on non-coding tasks like project management or coordination. This shift suggests that Copilot enables developers to focus on what they do best\u2014turning ideas into working code.2. Greater Autonomy and ExplorationCopilot encourages developers to experiment and explore solutions rather than just optimizing existing ones. This effect is especially pronounced for less experienced developers, who gain confidence and independence by relying on Copilot for repetitive tasks.3. Flattening Organizational HierarchiesBy empowering less experienced developers to take on more core coding work, Copilot reduces reliance on team collaboration for routine tasks. This dynamic has the potential to flatten hierarchies, making teams more efficient and individual contributors more impactful.4. The Power of IntegrationCopilot\u2019s deep integration with GitHub\u2019s ticketing and source control workflows amplifies its impact, streamlining task management and execution in a way that feels seamless for developers.The diversity of AI tools reflects the broad range of challenges they aim to address in software development. Each class has its own strengths and limitations, and their impact depends heavily on the tool\u2019s design, purpose, and integration into workflows.What the Study Misses: Limitations and Broader ImplicationsWhile Copilot\u2019s integration with GitHub workflows enhances efficiency, it also raises a broader question: Are these changes unique to Copilot\u2019s design and use case, or do they reflect a larger trend across different types of AI tools? Tools that target other stages of the development lifecycle\u2014like debugging or documentation\u2014may offer equally significant, but distinct, impacts.The study\u2019s narrow focus on Copilot prompts further exploration: Could AI tools with different designs, integrations, or use cases deliver similar outcomes? Or are these changes unique to Copilot\u2019s specific functionality and its deep coupling with GitHub workflows?Integration-Driven OutcomesCopilot\u2019s success depends heavily on its tight coupling with GitHub workflows. Tools with less integration or broader functionality may not deliver the same efficiency gains.Skill-Specific ImpactsThe autonomy Copilot provides to less experienced developers might not translate to tools catering to different skill levels or specialized workflows.Scope of TasksThe study focuses on core coding tasks, leaving out how AI tools impact other aspects of development, such as debugging, knowledge sharing, or design.These limitations highlight the need to explore generative AI tools in a broader context, considering their varied purposes and impacts.Tool Classes for AI in Software DevelopmentThe GitHub Copilot study offers a glimpse into one category of AI tools, but the broader ecosystem spans a variety of tools, each addressing specific pain points in the development lifecycle. Let\u2019s explore five key classes of tools and their unique impacts:1. Code Assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Codeium)These tools specialize in autocompleting code, generating boilerplate, and accelerating workflows.Primary Use Case: Turning tickets into code, speeding up repetitive coding tasks, and automating routine development work.Strength: Optimizes productivity for both less experienced developers (who gain confidence and independence) and experienced developers (who save time on repetitive tasks).Limitation: While powerful for automating coding tasks, these tools may offer limited support for higher-level architectural decisions or debugging workflows.2. Conversational Coding Tools (e.g., Cursor, Cody)Conversational tools enable natural language interactions for brainstorming, debugging, and refining code collaboratively with an LLM.Primary Use Case: Problem-solving, collaborative debugging, and generating contextual answers for ambiguous or complex coding challenges.Strength: Enhances creativity, team engagement, and decision-making by fostering discussions around code.Limitation: These tools rely heavily on how teams adopt collaboration practices. They may be less impactful for teams with rigid workflows or well-defined tasks.3. Knowledge Management and Documentation Tools (e.g., GitBook AI, Obsidian AI)These tools focus on generating and managing documentation or summarizing knowledge for technical teams.Primary Use Case: Automating the creation of documentation, technical manuals, and meeting summaries.Strength: Streamlines knowledge dissemination, reduces time spent on writing, and ensures technical details are documented efficiently.Limitation: Effectiveness depends on integration with team workflows and the quality of the source material. They may struggle to handle complex, unstructured knowledge without additional input.4. Data Preparation and Transformation Tools (e.g., Snowflake AI integrations, dbt)These tools automate data preparation, cleaning, and transformation\u2014essential for AI-driven systems and analytics workflows.Primary Use Case: Automating data pipelines, preparing datasets for machine learning, and ensuring data integrity for analytics.Strength: Improves efficiency for data engineering teams, enabling high-quality inputs for downstream AI applications.Limitation: Requires significant setup or expertise, which can be a barrier for smaller teams or those without dedicated data engineers.Why This MattersThe diversity of AI tools reflects the broad range of challenges they aim to address in software development. Each class has its own strengths and limitations, and their impact depends heavily on the tool\u2019s design, purpose, and integration into workflows.For example, a tightly integrated code assistant like GitHub Copilot excels at streamlining core coding tasks but may not address debugging or collaborative workflows as effectively as conversational tools like Cursor. Similarly, tools for knowledge management or data preparation solve entirely different problems, reinforcing the idea that no single AI tool can meet all developer needs.The Role of IntegrationOne of the most significant factors in an AI tool\u2019s impact is how seamlessly it integrates with existing workflows. Copilot\u2019s tight connection to GitHub allows it to function as a natural extension of ticket-based workflows, amplifying its influence on core coding tasks.By contrast, tools like Cursor, which emphasize conversation and multimodal inputs, may have a broader but less direct impact. Their value lies in facilitating exploration, debugging, and creative problem-solving rather than streamlining narrowly defined workflows.Skill Levels and Team DynamicsThe Copilot study found that less experienced developers benefited most from the tool, gaining autonomy and confidence. But other tools may target different skill levels or team dynamics. For example:Code assistants: Help junior developers focus on coding fundamentals.Conversational tools: Foster collaboration and problem-solving, benefiting teams working on ambiguous or complex projects.Knowledge tools: Reduce documentation overhead, aiding cross-functional teams or onboarding processes.Each tool class reshapes workflows in distinct ways, suggesting that the broader impacts of generative AI depend heavily on the design and purpose of the tools in question.Why Tool Class MattersThese differences highlight a critical point: the effects of generative AI in software development aren\u2019t universal. They depend on thetool class\u2014its design, purpose, and integration. A tool designed to streamline ticket-to-code workflows will have a fundamentally different impact than one focused on debugging, design, or knowledge sharing.The GitHub Copilot study is a valuable piece of the puzzle, but understanding AI\u2019s broader impact requires examining the full range of tools and how they interact with developers\u2019 workflows.What This Means for the Future of WorkThe Copilot study illustrates how generative AI tools are reshaping the workplace, but it\u2019s just the beginning. Generative AI doesn\u2019t simply automate tasks\u2014it changes how we approach them. These tools are enabling developers to focus on higher-value work, collaborate more effectively, and even redefine team structures.The diversity of AI tool classes underscores the importance of thoughtful design and integration. As these tools evolve, they will continue to reshape workflows, team dynamics, and the broader software development ecosystem.ConclusionThe Harvard Business School study on GitHub Copilot offers a glimpse into the future of work in software development. By focusing on core coding tasks, fostering autonomy, and flattening hierarchies, Copilot exemplifies the transformative potential of generative AI tools.But as the ecosystem of tools expands, we must recognize that not all tools will have the same impact. The rise of AI tool classes reminds us that design and integration matter as much as the technology itself. Understanding how these tools complement each other will be key to pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in software development.Generative AI is already changing how we work, but the real story is still unfolding. The challenge is to embrace these tools thoughtfully, harnessing their potential to create better workflows, stronger teams, and smarter solutions.As AI tools continue to evolve, how will you integrate them into your workflow to stay ahead in this rapidly changing landscape?AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

From drafting content to automating tasks, these \"stupid machines\" prove that utility\u2014not intelligence\u2014drives their economic and practical significance.Travis FrisingerSep 5, 2024\u20225 min readArtificial Intelligence: Harnessing Iteration and Practical Value for Economic ImpactImagine a machine that doesn\u2019t understand a single word it generates, yet can write essays, debug code, and even offer philosophical insights. How is this possible? The answer lies in the surprising capabilities of LLMs. At their core, these models are sophisticated next-word predictors\u2014they don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d the text the way humans do. Yet, despite this simplicity, LLMs often exhibit behaviors that seem intelligent. If they\u2019re just \"stupid machines,\" why do they seem so capable, and why is there immense utility and economic value in them, even if they don\u2019t necessarily get \u201csmarter\u201d?Next-Word Prediction and Emergent BehaviorHow Next-Word Prediction WorksAt its heart, an LLM predicts the next word in a sequence of text. This may seem straightforward, but the sheer scale of these models\u2014trained on billions or even trillions of words\u2014enables them to generate impressive outputs. LLMs can write essays, produce code, summarize long texts, and even engage in philosophical debates. They perform tasks that feel intelligent, even though they are simply predicting one word at a time.One of the most critical aspects of LLMs is that their value doesn\u2019t come from single-shot interactions. Instead, their true power comes from the iterative process of refinement and collaboration between the human user and the model.The Emergence of Complex CapabilitiesOne of the most fascinating aspects of LLMs is emergent behavior\u2014abilities that arise from the complexity of the model, even though it wasn\u2019t explicitly trained for those tasks. For example, while LLMs weren\u2019t specifically programmed to write code, they can generate and debug code with remarkable accuracy. This is where machine learning\u2019s magic lies: an enormous dataset and a powerful model can lead to surprising, useful outcomes.But why does this happen? It\u2019s not magic\u2014it\u2019s the result of LLMs picking up patterns deeply embedded in vast datasets. These patterns don\u2019t just match words; they encompass relationships between ideas, structures of language, and abstract concepts. This allows LLMs to handle complex tasks like writing essays or solving problems by leveraging a vast web of relationships between language and context. Though they don\u2019t \"understand\" in the human sense, their predictive capabilities mirror reasoning through pattern recognition.The Human-Like Qualities of LLMsAs LLMs demonstrate their capabilities, we often project human qualities onto them. When an LLM generates a response that feels empathetic, insightful, or clever, it\u2019s easy to believe the machine possesses traits like understanding or wisdom. This phenomenon, known as anthropomorphization, reflects our instinct to attribute human-like qualities to non-human entities.However, this is a cognitive illusion. LLMs are not sentient, nor do they \"feel\" or \"understand\" the content they generate. They are statistical models executing predictions based on training data. When an LLM produces a thoughtful response, it\u2019s not because it comprehends nuance\u2014it\u2019s because it has identified patterns in text that correlate with similar outputs in its training data.This illusion, however, is not without value. In many cases, whether or not a machine truly understands something is irrelevant if it produces a result that meets the desired outcome. As long as the response is coherent and useful, the lack of true comprehension doesn\u2019t diminish the model\u2019s value. The same principle applies in areas like customer service chatbots, where empathy may be less important than resolving the customer\u2019s issue efficiently.Utility Over Intelligence: What Matters in Practice?This brings us to a critical realization: utility does not require intelligence. While LLMs don\u2019t possess self-awareness or human reasoning abilities, they still provide immense value. For example, an LLM can draft content in minutes, saving hours of manual labor. It can suggest lines of code to a developer, speeding up development and reducing errors. In each of these cases, the machine doesn\u2019t need to \"understand\" the task in the human sense\u2014it simply needs to be useful.Iteration and Co-Creation: The True Value of LLMsOne of the most critical aspects of LLMs is that their value doesn\u2019t come from single-shot interactions. Instead, their true power comes from the iterative process of refinement and collaboration between the human user and the model. Unlike traditional tools that require precise inputs, LLMs enable users to engage in a creative, interactive feedback loop.This process of iteration transforms LLMs from simple tools into co-creators. Users often start with an initial prompt that may not yield the perfect result. But through continuous interaction\u2014providing feedback, tweaking the input, and reshaping the outcome\u2014the LLM\u2019s responses evolve. Each iteration brings the user closer to their desired result, making the model more than just a \"stupid machine.\" It becomes an active participant in the creative process.For example, when drafting content with an LLM, the first output might be too generic. But with each revision, as you provide feedback, the output sharpens and becomes more aligned with your vision. Through iterative adjustments to your prompts, the model provides responses that better match your intentions over time.This is where the value of LLMs truly shines. They are not perfect on the first try, but they don\u2019t need to be. Their strength lies in the ability to refine outputs through iterative interactions, allowing users to adjust prompts and guide the model toward better results. Whether it\u2019s writing, coding, or brainstorming, LLMs excel as tools that can generate more relevant responses through continuous input adjustments.Limitations of LLMs: They're Not Always RightWhile LLMs offer impressive utility, it's important to acknowledge their limitations. They generate responses based on patterns in the data they've been trained on, and this means they can sometimes produce outputs that are inaccurate, biased, or misleading. They don\u2019t have a true understanding of the information and, as a result, are prone to errors\u2014especially in tasks requiring critical reasoning or factual accuracy.This is why human oversight remains crucial. LLMs excel when used as tools to assist and augment human work, but they\u2019re not infallible. Understanding these limitations helps ensure we use LLMs responsibly, knowing when to rely on them and when to apply further scrutiny.The Economic Value of \"Stupid Machines\"The economic impact of LLMs, even as \"stupid machines,\" is already significant. Companies use them to automate tasks, enhance customer interactions, and streamline content creation. In software development, LLMs assist developers by suggesting code snippets and automating repetitive tasks. In marketing, they generate personalized content at scale. Even in creative fields, LLMs help brainstorm and refine ideas.The value lies in the cost savings and productivity boosts these models offer. Businesses don\u2019t need AI to have human-like intelligence\u2014they need a tool that reduces costs, increases output, and enhances human workers\u2019 efficiency. Whether or not LLMs become \"smarter\" in the future, their current capabilities provide significant ROI, making them economically viable.Conclusion: Do LLMs Need to Get Smarter?Do LLMs need to get smarter to remain valuable? The answer is likely no. Their utility and economic value stem from their ability to assist, automate, and augment human work\u2014not from any semblance of human-like intelligence. Even if these models never achieve true understanding, they will still be immensely valuable because they perform their tasks well enough to create meaningful outcomes.As we continue to develop these systems, the focus may shift from increasing their \u201cintelligence\u201d to refining how we use them. By finding better ways to integrate LLMs into workflows and harnessing their emergent behaviors, we can unlock even more potential\u2014proving that even \"stupid machines\" can be incredibly useful.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

Using tools like Suno and ChatGPT, I composed music, wrote lyrics, and designed album art, showcasing the potential of AI to enhance and expedite the creative process.Travis FrisingerAug 1, 2024\u20223 min readI want to share the intriguing and creative process behind my metal album, \"Mr. Fluffle's Reign of Tiny Terror.\" This project was an experiment in using generative AI tools likeSunoandChatGPTto compose music, write lyrics, and even create album art. Let's dive into how this unique project came to life.Why Create a Metal Album About My Cat?You might be wondering, why a metal album about my cat, Mr. Fluffles, also known as Dante? The idea was to experiment with generative AI in a creative context beyond software development\u2014something unfamiliar to me, which would also help me build new skills.Although I'm a classically trained pianist and have some experience in music production through friends who own studios, this was a different challenge. I wanted a quick route to being creative and releasing the silly songs that occupy my mind.Initially, I experimented with Suno by creating silly songs like \"Banana Stew\" and \"Oatmeal Salad.\" These prototypes were fun and demonstrated Suno\u2019s capabilities.Using AI to Compose and CreateThere's always a tune playing in my head, and I love making up songs. Using AI tools, I was able to compose music, write lyrics, and even generate album art. This journey was filled with discovery and creativity.Exploring SunoAIFirst up, let's talk about Suno, or SunoAI\u2014an artificial intelligence music creation program. Suno is designed to generate realistic songs that combine vocals and instrumentals or purely instrumental tracks. It has been widely available since December 2023 after the launch of a web application in partnership with Microsoft, which included Suno as an optional plugin for Microsoft Copilot.If you're unfamiliar, Microsoft Copilot is a chat-based tool integrated into various Microsoft products, enabling users to generate content based on prompts. Suno works similarly, allowing you to prompt it with a simple description, mood, genre, or more detailed instructions, including lyrics, song titles, and structure.While Suno doesn\u2019t disclose the dataset used to train its AI, it claims to have safeguards against plagiarism and copyright infringement. I tested it by prompting in the style of well-known artists like Taylor Swift, and it refused, suggesting some level of protection against direct imitation.Initially, I experimented with Suno by creating silly songs like \"Banana Stew\" and \"Oatmeal Salad.\" These prototypes were fun and demonstrated Suno\u2019s capabilities, though they leaned more towards pop than metal. However, they gave me a foundation to build upon as I delved into creating more structured music.Leveraging the Community and StructureSuno's community feature is incredibly helpful. On its homepage, you'll find a showcase of popular songs across various genres, from drum and bass to indie pop and metal. The trending songs section allows you to reuse prompts, giving you a sense of how to structure your own music.Once I grasped the basics, I began integrating more detailed prompts. I combined these insights with another generative AI tool, ChatGPT, to refine the lyrics and structure. By analyzing different examples of metal band lyrics and melodies, I honed in on the thrashy style I enjoy.Creating \"Mr. Fluffle's Reign of Tiny Terror\" blended AI generation and personal creativity. It was about guiding the AI, making decisions, and refining the output to craft something unique.Integrating ChatGPTChatGPT played a crucial role in the lyrical and conceptual development of the album. After experimenting with few-shot prompting, I provided a list of album song titles and descriptions, asking ChatGPT to generate metal songs matching those criteria. The results were impressive, with ChatGPT crafting well-structured lyrics that fit the desired vibe.The key was maintaining a consistent thread in my work. By keeping the context in place, ChatGPT was able to produce coherent and stylistically aligned lyrics across the entire album.Creating Album ArtI initially used Suno's auto-generated options for the album art, but they lacked the personalized touch I wanted. I turned to ChatGPT\u2019s image editing capabilities, tweaking the designs until they matched the album\u2019s theme. This iterative process allowed me to remove text, adjust elements, and fine-tune the art, creating a cohesive visual representation of the music.Challenges and LimitationsDespite the successes, there were challenges. Suno's limited control over specific aspects of the music, such as tempo and vocal prominence, was frustrating. I often found myself wishing for more fine-tuned adjustments. Generating multiple versions and discarding near-perfect ones due to minor issues was time-consuming.However, advancements in Suno\u2019s models have been promising. The ability to generate longer songs and extend tracks suggests that more detailed modifications might be possible in the future.Reflecting on the ExperienceCreating \"Mr. Fluffle's Reign of Tiny Terror\" blended AI generation and personal creativity.

Integrating Human-Centered Design (HCD) principles ensures AI solutions are transparent, thus enhancing user trust.Travis FrisingerJul 26, 2024\u20228 min readAI and Human Centered DesignGen AI and SAT (Boolean Satisfiability Problem Solver) solvers likePySATare powerful tools capable of solving complex problems across various domains. However, to truly harness their potential, it is crucial to provide users with clear explanations of how these solutions are derived. This aligns perfectly with human-centered design (HCD) principles, which focus on creating solutions that are empathetic, inclusive, intuitive, and transparent. In this blog, we'll explore how integrating HCD principles can enhance the user experience with Gen AI, using the example of generating a Fibonacci sequence.Integrating experiences from working on SAT solvers for youth sports scheduling, I noticed the critical need for explainability and managing response latency, especially when technologies involve human interaction. These lessons are invaluable when transitioning to Gen AI, where similar challenges arise. By addressing these issues, we can build more reliable and user-friendly AI systems.The human needs to remain in the loop and able to actively carry the solution context back into their work if we are to effectively co-create with Gen AI.Gen AI and SAT SolversGen AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate human-like text, code, art, and more. SAT Solvers are algorithms used to determine if a given Boolean formula can be satisfied, with applications in hardware verification, software testing, logistics and scheduling.The relationship between SAT solvers and Gen AI lies in their ability to handle complex problem-solving. Both require transparent decision-making processes and efficient handling of data. Lessons from SAT solvers, such as the importance of clear solution explanations and minimizing latency, are directly applicable to Gen AI. These principles help in making AI systems more understandable and efficient, ensuring better user experiences.While these technologies are adept at providing solutions, the real value lies in their ability to explain the reasoning behind these solutions. This fosters trust, aids learning, and allows users to adapt the solutions to their specific contexts.The Role of Human-Centered DesignHuman-Centered Design (HCD) is a crucial approach in creating technology that genuinely serves its users. By focusing on the user experience, HCD ensures that products are not only functional but also empathetic, inclusive, intuitive, and transparent. This methodology emphasizes the importance of understanding user needs and contexts, making technology accessible to all users, ensuring ease of use, and providing clear, traceable information. Integrating HCD principles into the development of Gen AI can significantly enhance their usability, accessibility, and trustworthiness.A Brief History of Human-Centered DesignHuman-Centered Design (HCD) has a rich history rooted in the evolution of user experience (UX) design and the broader field of design thinking. Here\u2019s a concise overview of its development:Early Beginnings: Ergonomics and Human FactorsThe origins of HCD can be traced back to the early 20th century, particularly during World War II, when the need for designing equipment that fit human capabilities became paramount. Ergonomics and human factors engineering emerged to optimize the interaction between people and machines, leading to more efficient and safer designs.1960s-1970s: The Rise of Cognitive PsychologyIn the 1960s and 1970s, the field of cognitive psychology began to influence design thinking. Researchers like Donald Norman, a key figure in HCD, emphasized understanding how people perceive, remember, and solve problems. This period saw the development of user-centered design (UCD), focusing on making systems more intuitive and user-friendly.1980s: The Computer RevolutionThe advent of personal computing in the 1980s brought HCD to the forefront of software development. Apple, with its Macintosh, was a pioneer in emphasizing user-friendly interfaces. The graphical user interface (GUI) became a standard, making computers accessible to a broader audience. This era solidified the importance of designing with the user in mind.1990s-2000s: UX Design and Design ThinkingThe 1990s and 2000s witnessed the formalization of UX design and the widespread adoption of design thinking. IDEO, a global design firm, popularized design thinking\u2014a methodology centered on empathy, ideation, and experimentation. This approach emphasized understanding users\u2019 needs and contexts, leading to more innovative and effective solutions.2010s-Present: Integrating HCD with Emerging TechnologiesIn the 2010s, HCD principles began to integrate with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The focus shifted towards creating seamless, intuitive, and inclusive experiences across diverse platforms and devices. Today, HCD is a critical aspect of designing complex systems, ensuring that technology serves human needs effectively.Core Principles of Human-Centered DesignHuman-Centered Design (HCD) is about designing products with the user in mind. This involves:Empathy:Understanding user needs and contexts.Inclusivity:Making technology accessible to all users.Intuitiveness:Ensuring ease of use and reducing the learning curve.Transparency:Providing clear, understandable, and traceable information.HCD ensures that products are not only functional but also usable and accessible. This approach reduces frustration, increases satisfaction, and promotes widespread adoption. Integrating these principles into Gen AI can significantly enhance its usability, accessibility, and trustworthiness. By providing clear and understandable explanations, users can validate and learn from the solutions, ensuring that technology serves their needs effectively.It\u2019s no longer just about generating a basket of choices; I can now trust the AI to refine and enhance ideas based on my input. This feels like a significant step forward in co-creating with Gen AI.Applying HCD Principles: Fibonacci Sequence ExampleLet's explore how these principles can be applied using the example of generating some code to create a Fibonacci sequence with ChatGPT.Enhancing Explainability and TransparencyWhen I asked ChatGPT tocreate a fib sequence method in python,it produced the following output:Fibonacci sequenece without comments but a detailed explaintion that followHere, each step is not clearly explained in code with comments but as a summary after, making it easier for users to understand the logic without cluttering the code.Another example of this would be the inverse where there is no summary but solely the use of comments in the code as a way of explaining.Fibonacci sequenece with commentsBoth approaches explain the solution well providing a high trust experience for the user ensuring they carry the context of the solution back into their work, not just copying and pasting it because the machine said so. Its all about collaboration, not just delegation.The goal should be explainability in the solution achieved, be it code, images, audio, etc. The human needs to remain in the loop and able to actively carry the solution context back into their work if we are to effectively co-create with Gen AI. By incorporating interactive features, we can further enhance this understanding and engagement to allow for a deeper level of fidelity.Interactive FeaturesCreating an interactive section where code can run and users can input different values of 'n' to see the sequence generated in real-time can enhance understanding. Providing explanations for each step as the sequence is built ensures that users can follow along and grasp the underlying logic. This interactivity makes learning more engaging and effective.I noticed the critical need for explainability and managing latency, especially when technologies involve human interaction.Expanding on this concept, we can relate it toconversational artifacts. By producing well-documented interactive experiences as a result of dialogue, we advance our maturity in HCD. These structured content fragments, like code snippets and diagrams, turn AI interactions into productive collaborations. Conversational artifacts organize complex information, facilitate iterative development, and enhance collaboration by providing a shared reference point. They transform AI conversations into tangible and valuable outputs.Claude AI's Artifacts feature is an excellent example of this. Artifacts in Claude are dedicated windows that display substantial, standalone content generated in response to a user\u2019s request. This can include documents, code snippets, diagrams, and interactive components. By providing structure, persistence, and clarity to AI interactions, artifacts boost clarity and human-AI collaboration, transforming how we work, learn, and create in the AI age.In the example below, I asked Claude to \"make me a react app version of space invaders\". It produced an interactive application that I can chat with to change as well as, documenting the code and provided detailed explanations of what it implemented.  Thus providing me with level of higher trust of my interaction with Gen AI.Claude's Conversation Artifact: Space Invader Game RunningChatGPT offers similar functionality to conversational artifacts with images, allowing users to select an image for refinement or choose specific regions to modify. For example, I used Gen AI to create an image for a song my daughter and I made up about her cat Pink chasing a bird. I was able to select a region of the image and give specific directions to ChatGPT on what to do. This detailed level of interaction with Gen AI is only possible due to the interactive nature of the initial output request. It\u2019s no longer just about generating a basket of choices; I can now trust the AI to refine and enhance ideas based on my input. This feels like a significant step forward in co-creating with Gen AI.Editing an image in ChatGPT's conversational interface editorBuilding Trust Through ExplainabilityCreating an environment of trust is fundamental when integrating AI into any system. Trust is the cornerstone that allows users to feel confident in the technology. One of the most effective ways to build this trust is through explainability.Transparency in Decision-MakingClearly outlining the decision-making process of the AI helps build trust. Showing intermediate steps and the logic used to arrive at the solution provides users with a deeper understanding and confidence in the AI's outputs. Transparency ensures that users can follow the AI's reasoning, making the technology more trustworthy.Validation MechanismsProviding ways for users to validate and verify the solutions is essential. Allowing users to compare the generated sequence with known benchmarks ensures they can trust the accuracy of the AI's outputs. Validation mechanisms are crucial for establishing reliability and credibility.PersonalizationAllowing users to customize the level of detail in explanations based on their familiarity with the subject matter enhances the user experience. For beginners, providing more detailed explanations and visual aids is beneficial, while advanced users might prefer a brief overview. Personalization ensures that the technology meets the needs of a diverse user base.ConclusionAs companies adopt Gen AI into their software and processes, integrating human-centered design principles can significantly enhance trustworthiness. Providing clear and understandable explanations not only helps users validate and learn from the solutions but also ensures that technology serves their needs effectively. The Fibonacci sequence example demonstrates how step-by-step breakdowns, visual aids, interactive features, and detailed annotations can transform complex solutions into comprehensible and valuable tools for users. The lessons learned from working with SAT solvers, such as the importance of clear solution paths and minimizing latency, can be directly applied to Gen AI, ensuring better user experiences and more effective collaboration between humans and AI.Call to ActionLet's continue to advocate for and implement explainability in our Gen AI solutions. By doing so, we build trust with our users, fostering a collaborative environment where AI serves as a reliable and understandable partner in the creative process.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

This technique is making our AI interactions more productive, organized, and insightful. But what exactly are conversational artifacts, and why should you care? Let's dive in.What are Conversational Artifacts?Conversational artifacts are structured pieces of content generated during AI conversations. Unlike the fleeting nature of typical chat exchanges, these artifacts are designed to capture, organize, and present complex information in a more permanent and easily referenceable format.The experiment here is the experience, not the output.Think of them as the tangible outcomes of your AI interactions\u2014code snippets, markdown documents, diagrams, or even structured data sets. They're not just responses; they're collaborative creations that emerge from the dialogue between humans and machines.The Purpose of Conversational ArtifactsThe primary goal of conversational artifacts is to enhance the value and utility of AI conversations. They serve several key purposes:Organizing Complex Information:In lengthy discussions about intricate topics, artifacts help structure information logically and coherently.Facilitating Iterative Development:Ideas can be captured, refined, and built upon more easily when they're presented as artifacts.Enhancing Collaboration:Artifacts provide a shared reference point for both humans and AI, fostering better understanding and cooperation.How Conversational Artifacts WorkThe process of generating artifacts during a conversation is seamless and intuitive. As you chat with an AI, it identifies opportunities to create artifacts based on the conversation's content and context. These artifacts are then presented within the chat interface, ready for your review, modification, or further discussion.They are expanded to the side, where a user can interact with them directly, isolated from the main chat thread. Additionally, users can further refine them by continuing to chat in the main chat or by direct editing. A conversation artifact is referenced in the chat dialog, providing a link to the detailed artifact view.The AI plays a crucial role in this process, not only in generating the artifacts but also in managing them\u2014updating, versioning, and linking them as the conversation evolves. Users can interact with these artifacts directly, editing them, asking for modifications, or using them as springboards for new ideas.The solitaire game is referenced in the chat dialog.The solitaire game is a conversational artifact to the right of the main chat.The code it produces may not always be perfect, but the focus is on the experience, not the output. It's about enabling quick iterations of ideas with a short feedback loop.Integrating Artifacts with ClaudeAnthropic\u2019s Claude AI has taken a significant step forward with the introduction of itsArtifacts feature. Artifacts in Claude are dedicated windows that display substantial, standalone content generated in response to a user\u2019s request. This can include:Documents (Markdown or Plain Text)Code snippetsWebsites (single page HTML)Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) imagesDiagrams and flowchartsInteractive React componentsBy providing structure, persistence, and clarity to our AI interactions, they're set to transform how we work, learn, and create in the AI age.With Artifacts, Claude can create content that is significant and self-contained, typically over 15 lines, which users are likely to edit, iterate on, or reuse outside the conversation. This feature transforms Claude from a mere conversational AI to a dynamic co-creation environment. By supporting various content types\u2014such as Markdown documents, SVG images, and React components\u2014Artifacts enable real-time visualization, interactive coding, and collaborative workspaces.Enhancing Collaboration with Fork and Merge ConceptsPreviously, I considered using a fork and merge technique in my chats to better ideate and collaborate with AI. This approach would have involved creating separate branches of conversation threads with a fork operation that could later be merged, similar to version control in software development. While effective, this method would have been complex and required meticulous management. Just like version control in software. Not exactly the most seamless experience for a user.Conversational Artifacts offer a simpler and richer experience for human-AI collaboration. By generating standalone pieces of content that can be directly interacted with, these artifacts streamline the creative process and enhance productivity. This represents a significant leap forward in our conversational AI journey, providing a more intuitive and effective way to harness AI\u2019s capabilities.Benefits of Using Conversational ArtifactsThe advantages of incorporating conversational artifacts into AI interactions are numerous:Improved Clarity and Structure:Complex ideas are distilled into clear, organized formats.Easy Reference and Iteration:Artifacts serve as persistent records that can be easily revisited and refined.Enhanced Productivity:By capturing key outputs in a structured format, artifacts streamline workflows and reduce redundancy.Focusing on Code: A Closer LookIn the realm of software development, conversational artifacts can be particularly transformative. Consider a scenario where you\u2019re discussing a complex algorithm with an AI. As you explore different approaches, the AI can generate code snippets that are immediately useful. These code artifacts are not only snippets of syntax but structured pieces of functional code that can be edited, tested, and integrated into larger projects. It's a more natural and pleasant way to code with AI when compared to the alternative of co-pilot in the IDE.The Future of Conversational ArtifactsAs AI technology advances, we can expect conversational artifacts to become more sophisticated and integrated into our daily workflows. We might see:Standardization across AI platforms, allowing for seamless sharing and collaboration.Integration with other AI technologies like computer vision or predictive analytics.More dynamic and interactive artifacts that evolve in real-time during conversations.ConclusionConversational artifacts represent a significant leap forward in human-AI collaboration. By providing structure, persistence, and clarity to our AI interactions, they're set to transform how we work, learn, and create in the AI age.As this technology continues to evolve, its potential applications are boundless. Whether you're a developer, educator, manager, or creative professional, conversational artifacts offer a powerful new tool for harnessing the full potential of AI-assisted work.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

On one side, it promises endless productivity and human flourishing. On the other, it threatens to wipe out entire swaths of the workforce. But the truth is more complicated\u2014and more urgent.Jobs Aren\u2019t Dying. They\u2019re Shifting.AI isn\u2019t killing jobs wholesale; it\u2019s reshaping how work gets done. We\u2019re not witnessing a one-for-one replacement of humans by machines.We\u2019re watching workflows being rewritten\u2014with AI as a tireless collaborator.Still, displacement is real. Repetitive, rules-based jobs are most at risk: data entry, junior analysis, customer service. We've seen this before\u2014the ATM didn\u2019t kill banking jobs; it changed them. The spreadsheet didn\u2019t destroy finance teams; it leveled them up. But today\u2019s shift is faster and deeper. AI doesn\u2019t just optimize a role\u2014it can absorb it entirely.The Disappearing RungsThe deeper issue isn\u2019t just that jobs are changing\u2014it\u2019swhichjobs are disappearing. We're not just automating roles. We\u2019re automating the bottom rungs of the professional ladder.Entry-level work has always been where talent grows. Junior developers learn by debugging messy code. Analysts grow by wrestling with raw data. Assistants pick up the rhythms of leadership by osmosis. These roles were never glamorous\u2014but they built careers.Now?McKinsey is training AI to replace junior analysts.Tools like Cursor can refactor codebases with a prompt.LLM-based agents summarize meetings, manage schedules, and draft content.This isn\u2019t just disruption. It\u2019s disintermediation oflearning. If the junior tier is hollowed out, where will the next generation build their intuition, context, and judgment?Education Is OutpacedUniversities lag. Bootcamps oversell. Most education systems can't keep up with how fast the ground is shifting. Worse, they still train people for jobs that either won\u2019t exist\u2014or that AI will do better and cheaper.What we need isn\u2019t more certificates.It\u2019s moreonramps that still exist.The Barbell EconomyWe\u2019re already seeing examples in the real world. Klarna cut hundreds of employees after deploying AI agents to handle tasks once assigned to operations and support teams. McKinsey\u2019s AI initiatives aim to automate junior analyst work across industries. At the same time, companies like PwC and EY are quietly restructuring entire workflows to lean more on AI-enhanced knowledge work, reducing the need for manual white-collar labor across departments. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has deployed AI copilots to assist financial analysts and compliance teams\u2014automating the grunt work, yes, but also scaffolding new roles focused on risk escalation and model validation. In manufacturing, Bosch has begun blending AI with apprenticeship programs\u2014using machine learning to assist junior operators while retaining human oversight.We\u2019re heading toward a barbell-shaped labor market:On one end: elite operators using AI to 10x their output.On the other: workers whose jobs are quietly automated away.In the middle: a growing void.No gradual climb. No steady skill progression. Just a jump\u2014or a fall.The middle is soggy\u2014bloated with cost, resistant to change, propped up by vague productivity and busywork.AI is coming not just for the rote and junior, but for the middling roles that survive by navigating bureaucracy and managing inertia.Manual labor isn\u2019t limited to blue-collar work. Many white-collar roles persist by grinding through approvals, formatting docs, or copying status updates. AI is exposing the inefficiency of this \"knowledge work factory floor\"\u2014and many of those workflows are being redesigned out of existence.We risk building a caste system of work:Those whocommandAI.Those whocompetewith it.And those who are simplydisplacedby it.But what about the counter-narrative? Some argue that AI creates new rungs\u2014that prompt engineer, AI trainer, and model auditor are today\u2019s entry points. While that\u2019s partially true, these roles are often inaccessible to those without prior experience or domain fluency. They're not new rungs so much as entirely different ladders.Without intervention, AI won\u2019t just concentratewealth. It will concentrateopportunity. Those with early access, support, and context will surge ahead\u2014not because they\u2019re smarter, but because the ladder was still there for them.We risk building a caste system of work:Those whocommandAI.Those whocompetewith it.And those who are simplydisplacedby it.Tacit Knowledge Is At RiskWhen a junior product analyst shadowed a customer support escalation, they didn\u2019t just take notes\u2014they learned how to diffuse tension, translate ambiguity into insight, and watch a veteran connect data to action in real time. That kind of tacit knowledge isn\u2019t taught. It\u2019s absorbed.It\u2019s not just skills that vanish when junior roles disappear\u2014it\u2019stacit knowledge. The subtle judgment calls, the unwritten norms, the ability to read the room or handle a client call after watching a mentor do it a dozen times. These are things that aren't in the handbook and don\u2019t show up in documentation. They\u2019re absorbed through exposure.If junior workers aren\u2019t around to observe, contribute, and make small mistakes, they don\u2019t build the context that makes for good decision-making later. As a result, organizations risk growing brittle\u2014optimized for output, but shallow in depth.Without fresh talent growing through proximity and practice, succession plans stall. Mid-levels become overburdened. Senior talent retires or churns, and no one is ready to step up. The organizational memory shrinks.Organizations Are Not ReadyMost companies still reflect a pre-AI world. Job titles, performance metrics, and hiring pipelines all assume a talent structure that\u2019s eroding beneath them.If we eliminate the bottom:Who trains the top?Where does institutional memory come from?How do we promote people who never got to learn?A Call to Action for LeadersThe easy path is clear: automate the low end, cut costs, and report higher margins.The harder\u2014and more strategic\u2014path is torebuild the ladderwhile embracing AI.Here\u2019s what that looks like:Protect early-stage workDon\u2019t just automate it\u2014scaffold it. Assign humans to shadow AI-driven workflows and annotate outcomes. Expect more than passive observation: treat these as active training pipelines. Let people contribute, challenge, and escalate decisions. Build systems where early-stage workers aren\u2019t sidelined\u2014they\u2019re engaged, learning through structured exposure and feedback.Rethink performance metricsStop rewarding keystrokes. Start measuring judgment, clarity, and outcomes.Build internal training pathsIf the world can\u2019t teach them, you must. Move beyond lip service\u2014build structured apprenticeships where juniors pair with AI copilots and real teams. Give them ownership over specific deliverables, not sandboxed toy projects. Rotate them across domains. Expect real output, real judgment, and real mistakes. That's how growth happens.Embrace orchestration, not just executionThe most valuable employees won\u2019t be the ones who outwork the machine. They\u2019ll be the ones whodirectit with clarity and purpose.Widen accessMake AI tools and training available across your org. Don\u2019t let AI fluency become a gatekeeping mechanism. Uplift and support departmental champions\u2014workflow insights and adjustments will come from those closest to the work.The Future Is AI-Augmented, Not AI-DominatedThe best workers won\u2019t be those who do what AI can\u2019t.They\u2019ll be the ones who know how to use it wisely.And the best organizations won\u2019t be those who cut first.They\u2019ll be the ones whoinvest in learning, design for hybrid teams, and build a future that includes everyone\u2014not just the AI-native elite.This isn\u2019t just a time to shrink the workforce.It\u2019s a time to reshape it.Final ThoughtThis isn\u2019t a crisis of efficiency\u2014it\u2019s a crisis of opportunity.The real test? Creating an AI\u2011infused workforce built on judgment, escalation, and human oversight.Leaders who commit to preserving learning spaces while embracing AI will not only win in output\u2014they\u2019ll winsustainably, with people still climbing the ladder, not falling through it.FeaturedThe Coherence Trap: Why LLMs Feel Smart (But Aren't Thinking)LLMs don\u2019t think\u2014they resonate.

Prompts that once yielded stiff or robotic replies now returned answers that felt... uncanny. The responses weren\u2019t just correct\u2014they werecoherent. They carried tone, structure, even momentum. It felt like you were talking to something that understood you.But it wasn\u2019t understanding. It was coherence.The TrapLarge Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o don\u2019t reason. They don\u2019t plan. They have no self-awareness. Yet theyfeelintelligent.This is theCoherence Trap\u2014the illusion of cognition created by language that resonates with structure and context. We assume meaning because it fits. But what\u2019s really happening under the hood is something else entirely.How Coherence EmergesLLMs generate tokens by predicting the most likely next word based on context. But this prediction is shaped by a massive set of latent structures\u2014syntax, tone, prior associations, narrative forms, and more. When these layers align, they create what I callcoherence reconstruction.Coherence reconstruction is not understanding. It\u2019s the echo of form, reinforced across attention layers. It\u2019s what makes a model appear consistent, insightful, or even witty\u2014without actuallythinking.The more your prompt scaffolds the right structure, the more likely the model is to \u201clock in\u201d to that coherence and hold it across outputs.This is why prompt design often feels like magic.Why Hallucinations HappenHallucinations aren\u2019t bugs. They\u2019re symptoms of structured resonance operating without anchors.When the model lacks grounding\u2014say, via retrieval or tightly framed prompts\u2014it still seeks to complete the pattern. It will generate plausible, fluent nonsense that fits the shape, even if it breaks truth. The structure is working, even if the facts aren\u2019t.From Compression to ReconstructionMuch of AI theory still frames these systems as compression engines: store, compress, retrieve.But LLMs offer something different:structured resonance. They rebuild meaning in the moment, using distributed activation patterns. The power isn\u2019t in what they remember\u2014it\u2019s in how they reassemble coherence in context.Design for Structured ResonanceThis insight has profound implications. If LLMs aren\u2019t thinking, but insteadresonating, then we must shift how we design systems around them.Prompting = Interface Design: Treat prompts as scaffolds, not one-offs.Structure = Stability: Use consistent tone, layout, and loops to reinforce resonance.Drift = Debug Signal: Coherence breaking down? It\u2019s a sign your structure lost alignment.RAG = Anchoring Gravity: Dense, relevant context pulls resonance toward truth.Engineering ImplicationsDesigning for structured resonance changes the engineering stack itself:Agent Design: Agents should be structured as orchestration layers that maintain coherence across tasks, not linear logic chains. Think modular, conversational state management over deep planning trees.PromptOps: Prompt engineering becomes a systems discipline. You'll need versioned, reusable prompt templates with enforced structure, scoped memory, and embedded feedback loops.Evaluation: Traditional eval metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fall short. Instead, we must measurecoherence under pressure\u2014can the model hold its tone, task, and flow across turns and failures?Debugging: Engineers should learn to recognize coherence drift the way they track memory leaks. It's a systemic fault, not a one-off glitch.Architecture: Multi-layer systems (e.g. Retrieval-Augmented Generation) must be designed toreinforce coherence, not just supply facts. Anchoring mechanisms, alignment feedback, and context shaping become first-class citizens.User Interfaces: UX needs to reflect iteration loops and contextual reinforcement\u2014not static chat boxes. Interfaces should help users co-steer resonance, not just send prompts into the void.This isn\u2019t just a new feature layer. It\u2019s a reframe of what AI engineering means.We\u2019re not building brains\u2014we\u2019re building coherence engines.Final ThoughtYou\u2019re not talking to a thinker. You\u2019re standing in front of a mirror with 8,001 dimensions. The model doesn\u2019t understand you\u2014but it reflects back a shape that feels like it does.That\u2019s the trap.Stop chasing intelligence. Start designing for structured resonance.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

The future of software is collaborative, fast, and evolving beyond the keyboard.For decades, writing code was the bottleneck.Typing was thinking.Craft was king.We taught principles like SOLID and Clean Code not just for quality, but because they werenecessary survival toolsin a world where humans were the engine behind every line of logic.But that world is changing.The New RealityAI-assisted coding \u2014 what some callvibe coding\u2014 is just the next step in the long arc of automation.It's not magic.It's not heresy.It's automation for a labor-intensive task: turning ideas into working code.And just like every wave of automation before it \u2014 from manufacturing to agriculture to graphic design \u2014it feels disorienting for those whose skills were tightly coupled to the manual process.So What's Actually Changing?The bottleneck has moved.Old bottleneck:\u201cHow do we write this?\u201dNew bottleneck:\u201cWhat are we trying to build?\u201d\u201cDoes it solve the problem?\u201d\u201cIs it safe, maintainable, and aligned with our goals?\u201dAI doesn't replace engineering.But itreplaces the idea that engineering = typing.The Role of Craft, RevisitedThe craft of software used to be abouthowwe wrote the code.Now, the craft is shifting toward:Framing and refining problemsValidating ideas quicklyNavigating ambiguityDesigning architectures that flex, scale, and adaptSOLID still matters \u2014 but only if the system benefits from it.Clean Code still matters \u2014 but AI can enforce formatting now.Unit tests still matter \u2014 but maybe you generate them from examples.In other words:Craft isn\u2019t gone \u2014 it\u2019s just moved up the stack.What This Means for EngineersThis is our automation moment.Some folks will double down on old habits and feel disillusioned.Others will evolve and thrive by shifting from control to orchestration.You don\u2019t have to be an expert in everything.But youdoneed to:Understand what you\u2019re buildingGuide the AI, not just prompt itReview and reason, not just shipVibe coding works best when you can think clearly \u2014 not just code fluently.Final ThoughtSoftware engineering is not dying.It\u2019sevolving.Faster than many expected.And like every profession that\u2019s been touched by automation, those who adapt will shape the future.Those who don\u2019t\u2026 may cling to an idea that stopped being true.We\u2019re not replacing engineers.We\u2019re replacing the need to handwrite everything just to deliver value.The ceremony is collapsing.The creativity is just beginning.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

A new ICLR paper backs my theory: coherence, not cognition, drives meaning. These models flow through context, not thought. That shift changes how we prompt, evaluate, and design with AI.Travis FrisingerApr 21, 2025\u20222 min readA visualization of coherence in motion\u2014language as flowing structure, not discrete thought.In my white paperAI Coherence: Meaning from Patterns, Not Memory, I argued that LLMs don\u2019t think in the traditional sense. They don\u2019t reason symbolically. They don\u2019t even operate over discrete chunks of meaning the way humans intuitively process language. Instead, they construct meaning throughcoherence\u2014 the internal alignment of context over time. They are coherence engines, not cognitive agents.A newly released ICLR 2025 paper,Language Models Are Implicitly Continuous, now gives empirical and mathematical weight to this idea.The Core Finding: Language is Treated as ContinuousDespite being trained on discrete tokens, LLMs behave as though they are interpreting language ascontinuous in time and space. The authors introduce a continuous extension of the Transformer architecture that doesn't change model weights but allows us to view LLM behavior as a flow over continuous functions.Through clever experiments, they demonstrate that:LLMs responddifferentlywhen thedurationof a token is varied.Interpolations between token embeddings (e.g., halfway between \u201capple\u201d and \u201cbanana\u201d) producemeaningful, plausible outputs.Pretrained models treat intermediate, never-before-seen vectors assemantic entities.This behavior suggests that LLMs operate over a smooth latent space where meaning is shaped by alignment and flow rather than symbolic inference.Coherence Theory Meets ContinuityThis paper validates a core tenet of my Coherence Theory:LLMs don't know things. They don't calculate. They align. They produce outputs thatfit\u2014 not because they understand, but because those outputs preserve contextual coherence.What the paper shows is that this coherence isn't just metaphorical. It\u2019sliterally continuous. Token durations modulate model behavior in ways humans can\u2019t intuit. Embedding space isn't just a lookup table; it's a terrain offluid meaning. And most importantly, this fluidity is what makes LLMs so powerful, and so alien.Implications for AI System DesignIf LLMs operate through continuous coherence, not discrete reasoning, then most current design assumptions need to be updated. Here's how:1.Prompt EngineeringPrompts aren't instructions. They're boundary conditions on a coherence field. You're shaping the flow of meaning, not issuing commands.2.Agent DesignAgents don\u2019t pursue goals like thinkers. They simulate coherence toward a goal when it\u2019s kept in context. Agency has to bescaffolded, not assumed.3.EvaluationTraditional metrics (accuracy, truthfulness) miss the point. You have to evaluate whether the outputfitsthe intent, the tone, the prior flow. Think: narrative alignment, not just correctness.4.InterpretabilityWe shouldn\u2019t just trace neuron activations. We should ask: what shape is this model holding? What trajectory is coherence pulling it toward?This Isn\u2019t Just Theory AnymoreThis new research paper gives us the math. It gives us experiments. But more importantly, it gives us language to talk about what so many of us have felt when working with these models:They don\u2019t think. They don\u2019t plan. They flow.And that flow iscoherence over time,not cognition.If you want to understand what LLMs really are and how to work with them effectively, you have to reframe your mental model.

This blog explores why the highest-leverage skill in modern engineering is architecting the right problem, not just solving one efficiently. Thinking is the new engineering.Travis FrisingerApr 9, 2025\u20224 min readFraming over building: In a world of AI-generated solutions, the real craft lies in shaping the problem.In the age of GenAI, the ground beneath the software industry is shifting fast. Code is no longer the bottleneck. It\u2019s not even the moat. The true differentiator now lies upstream, in the space where problems are framed, not just solved.Let\u2019s dive into what it means to\"architect the right problem to solve\"and why this mindset is fast becoming the highest-leverage skill in modern engineering.From Solution Architecture to Problem ArchitectureBefore we jump into code or tooling, we have to pause and ask: are we solving the right thing in the first place?Traditional software architecture asked:\u201cHow do we best build this system given requirements X, Y, Z?\u201dModern problem architecture asks:\u201cWhy are we building this system at all? Who decided on X, Y, Z? What if we reframed the entire premise?\u201dInstead of optimizing for delivery,we optimize for clarity. We uncover assumptions buried in old specifications, and challenge the mental models shaping them. Often, the real breakthrough doesn\u2019t come from better execution, but from better framing.Shifting from a narrow, solution-driven approach to a broader, problem-framing perspective opens up new insights before a single line of code is written.This shift matters because tools likeCursororClinecan already handle many implementation details.The role of the human engineer becomes less about instruction writingor finding the perfect abstraction, and more about curiosity, hypothesis framing, and reframing the playing field entirely.The Strategic Shift: Thinking as the ProductSoftware used to be the product. Now,thinkingis the product.Think of how many startups pivot not because they couldn't build, but because they were building the wrong thing.In a GenAI-enabled environment, the build phase is cheap.The explore, hypothesize, and shape phase is where all the value lives.This makes the ability to navigate ambiguous, complex domains more important than ever:Are we solving the root problem, or just a visible symptom?Have we asked why enough times to find the real need?Could we shift the value proposition without shipping a single feature?Being able to explore the problem space with the same rigor we once reserved for technical design is the new strategic skill.Why This Matters Now: The Collapse of Differentiation in CodeLet\u2019s face it: CRUD is dead weight\u2014AI can handle most commodity development tasks today. In greenfield or straightforward scenarios, code generation can dramatically reduce development time. However, that doesn\u2019t meanallsoftware is equally commoditized.Expert Code Still Has Its PlaceSome engineering challenges still demand deep expertise. High-performance computing, distributed systems, embedded systems, specialized cryptographic protocols, and complex integrations often require nuanced craftsmanship.AI-generated solutions can handle much of the \u201c80%\u201d work, but real engineering depth is still needed to fine-tune performance, ensure resilience, or meet unique domain constraints.The bottom line: code as a commoditydoesn\u2019tmean code is unimportant. It means the straightforward aspects of coding are no longer a differentiator\u2014the skill gap shiftstoward specialized or highly optimized scenarios.As a result, the real magic for many teams lies in how theyframe the problem, model their system, and discover hidden feedback loops. If you\u2019re building a standard app that simply stores data and shows it in a UI,you\u2019re no longer special by virtue of shipping code.But if you\u2019re pushing boundaries\u2014either in performance or in problem framing\u2014then you\u2019re playing in a domain where AI alone can\u2019t do the heavy lifting yet.Systems Thinking as Problem ArchitectureThinking like a systems designer is core to problem architecture:Where are the loops that amplify or dampen behavior?Where does friction accumulate and why?What interventions create cascading effects?Instead of thinking linearly (feature \u2192 user action \u2192 value), we begin to model feedback loops, leverage points, and ecosystem incentives. The best problem architects can simulate outcomes mentally before a line of code is written.Sometimes a better system isn\u2019t more software.It might be a change in defaults, a clearer policy, or a better metaphor. In this way, problem architecture borrows from service design, game design, and systems dynamics.Roles Are EvolvingAs problem-framing becomes central to building with AI, the responsibilities across teams are beginning to shift in meaningful ways.Theengineerbecomes a design-thinker with systems intuition.Thearchitectbecomes a problem strategist and facilitator.ThePMbecomes a curator of problem spaces and opportunity framings.The dividing lines between roles blur. Cross-functional teams who co-own the problem space will outperform siloed teams with well-defined but poorly understood requirements.When code is cheap and easily generated, strategic thinking becomes the true differentiator.In this landscape, the ones who rise are those who can:Ask great questions,Sense patterns and weak signals,Navigate ambiguity with clarity.Heuristics for Better Problem ArchitectureHere are some tactical tools to use when shaping the problem:Inverse the problem.If onboarding takes too long, ask: What would make onboarding irrelevant? Could we auto-provision? Could we reduce the need to onboard at all?Zoom in / out.What if this problem doesn\u2019t exist at this scale? Zoom out: is onboarding even the real pain? Zoom in: is the delay caused by one field or one decision?Redefine success.Instead of \u201cshow a dashboard,\u201d ask: What would make a user feel confident without needing a dashboard? Can we use nudges, summaries, or natural language interfaces instead?Model friction.Where do users stall, click away, or ask for help? Friction is often a signal of a deeper mismatch in mental models.Design from the future.If the ideal experience already existed, what would have to be true? This lets you work backward from a better future instead of forward from today\u2019s constraints.The Road Ahead: Thinking as a First-Class RoleWe\u2019re heading toward an industry where \"problem architects\" will be first-class citizens:People who frame.People who think in loops.People who know that the right problem, precisely framed, is already 80% solved.They will use AI toexplore solution spacequickly, not just execute it. They will operate like designers, researchers, and strategists all in one. Theirimpact will be measured in better decisions, not just better deployments.This is the dawn ofthinking as engineering. And in this new paradigm, toarchitect the right problem is to engineer the future.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

FLUID isn\u2019t just a philosophy, it\u2019s a new way of building with AI. Mutable by design. Shaped by collaboration.For years, I preached the gospel of SOLID principles. Single Responsibility. Open/Closed. Liskov. Interface Segregation. Dependency Inversion. They were more than guidelines \u2014 they were the scaffolding we built our software on. They helped us tame complexity, align on good design, and enforce structure where chaos threatened.But here\u2019s the thing no one wants to say out loud:a lot of it was about control.We shaped our code not because it was always better \u2014 but because it was safer. Easier to read, easier to change (sometimes), and easier to onboard humans. We made rules for each other to protect us from entropy.SOLID walked so FLUID could flow. AI-native development doesn\u2019t need control \u2014 it needs adaptability.But that world assumed ahuman-only audience. Now we write code that\u2019s read, interpreted, and modified by machines too.We\u2019re not just collaborating with people anymore \u2014 we\u2019re collaborating with intelligence.The rules change when your pair programmer never sleeps, sees the whole codebase, and can rewrite a service in seconds.We\u2019re not in the SOLID era anymore. We\u2019re in theFLUIDera.Introducing FLUID: Post-SOLID Principles for AI-Native DevelopmentWhen you\u2019re building with AI, you don\u2019t need to contort your mind to remember every design pattern or abstract perfectly. You write what works \u2014 and if it doesn\u2019t, you regenerate, refactor, or restructure with a prompt.Code is no longer sacred. It\u2019s disposable. Mutable. Co-authored with a machine.The new principles of software development aren\u2019t about rigidity \u2014 they\u2019re about adaptability.FLUIDis a mindset for workingwithAI,not trying to preserve an artifact against time.\ud83c\udf00 FLUID PrinciplesF \u2013Flexible CompositionDesign in loosely coupled, swappable parts. Think composability over inheritance, simple functions over deep hierarchies. Anything that helps AI (or you) reshape it later.L \u2013Live PrototypesWork live. Build in hot environments \u2014 REPLs, notebooks, dev servers \u2014 to explore ideas and tighten your feedback loop. But don\u2019t stop there: snapshot working prototypes and harden them through tests, CI, and version control.FLUID doesn\u2019t mean skipping rigor \u2014 it means deferring it until you\u2019ve found something worth solidifying.U \u2013Unified ContextCode with context. Focus on reducing ambiguity \u2014 your future self, teammates, and AI assistants will all benefit. Think less about documentation and more about supplying the system with meaningful, actionable information.I \u2013Intent-Driven StructureDon\u2019t just write for form, write for collaboration. Give functions, files, and variables meaningful names, but remember \u2014 the AI is reading too. Use comments to convey intent clearly, not just style. Prioritize clarity ofwhyso the system \u2014 human and machine \u2014 stays in sync.D \u2013Dynamic RefactorabilityExpect change. Encourage it. Make code easy to mutate, regenerate, and improve. Let the AI reshape your logic, reroll your structures, and keep the system flowing.The Shift: From Code as Artifact to Code as InterfaceWe used to write code for humans to read. Now we write it so humansand machinescan collaborate on it. AI doesn\u2019t care if your service is SOLID. It cares if it can parse, learn, adapt, and ship.We\u2019re moving faster. Thinking faster. Innovating on the edges and polishing later \u2014 if ever. What used to be weeks of code review and refactoring can now be done in seconds. The bottleneck isn\u2019t the code anymore. It\u2019s your imagination.So long live SOLID.It taught us how to think.But the world has changed.Let\u2019s move. Let\u2019s break things.Let\u2019s build with machines, not for them.But Wait \u2014 Not All Code Will Be FLUID (Yet)Let\u2019s be real: some codebases aren\u2019t ready for this. There\u2019s still plenty of mission-critical, high-risk, legacy infrastructure out thereand some faction of old-school engineers will keep guarding that temple.Let them. Their job is stability.The FLUID mindset isn\u2019t a universal replacement. It\u2019s aforkin the evolutionary tree. Where stability and compliance reign, SOLID still makes sense.

It\u2019s a shift from syntax to intent, from isolated tasks to conversation. Whether guiding agents or prompting apps, the real story is how we think and build with machines.Travis FrisingerMar 27, 2025\u20224 min readVibe coding collapses the gap between idea and execution and accelerates value creation faster than anything the software industry has seen.We\u2019re witnessing a generational shift in how software is made. It\u2019s not just another tooling update. It\u2019s a full-spectrum change inhow ideas become code\u2014faster, more fluid, more assistive, and more collaborative.A recent lecture by Don Syme (KCL, March 2025) inspired me to reflect on my 30+ years of writing software. From GCC and Vim, flipping through printed manuals to AI-powered co-creation. This piece is a personal tracing of that arc.AI-assisted coding is no longer a novelty. It\u2019s quickly becoming thedefault modefor modern software development. But the story isn\u2019t just about the latest tools\u2014it\u2019s about how they reflect deeper changes in how developersthink, interact,and build.To understand why AI-assisted coding is taking over, let\u2019s trace the arc that brought us here.Phase 1: Pinpoint Surgery (2022\u20132023)AI entered the dev world not with a bang, but with an autocomplete.The first wave of AI in development\u2014GitHub Copilot and Cody \u2014focused onpinpoint assistance. You were already in the code, and the AI helped with completions, summaries, or boilerplate generation. Magic, but localized.But this wasn\u2019t the first time developers wrestled with a paradigm shift in tooling.I still remember the year 2000.We were writing C++ inBorland\u2019s Turbo C++, a full-screen DOS-style environment. No real autocomplete, no inline docs, no jump-to-definition. You memorized headers, flipped through manuals, and debugged withprintf.Around the same time,Java IDEs like Eclipse were just starting to emerge, clunky and bloated but showing the promise of structured tooling.And when autocomplete first arrived, it was met with skepticism\u2014especially in academic circles.My professors warned us:\u201cDon\u2019t use that. It\u2019ll ruin your ability to look things up.\u201dBut even then, the writing was on the wall.Autocomplete wasn\u2019t cheating. It wasshorthand. It let you move faster, focus on what mattered, and worry less about the mechanics of syntax. You didn\u2019t need to remember every method in the Java Collections Framework\u2014you just needed to recognize the right one when it appeared.And gradually, the expectations shifted.You didn\u2019t have to implement a red-black tree to understand sorted sets.You didn\u2019t need to write your own hash map to understand lookup performance.Youusedthose tools. You didn\u2019t rebuild them.The same thing is happening now with AI-assisted coding.The anxiety today sounds just like it did back then\u2014only now the fear is:\u201cIf the AI writes your function, do you even understand what it\u2019s doing?\u201dBut here\u2019s the truth:You didn\u2019t need to memorize APIs in 2000.You don\u2019t need to memorize boilerplate in 2025.What matters is still the same:Do you understand the problem?Can you debug what you didn\u2019t write?Can you build something that works and lasts?AI is just the next layer in that ongoing evolution\u2014from raw code to composed systems, from memorization to orchestration.Phase 2: Task-Oriented Coding (2024)Then the paradigm began to shift.Rather than only assisting at thepoint of code, tools likeCopilot Workspace, orCursor Composerstarted focusing onthe intent behind the task\u2014the bug you wanted to fix, the feature you wanted to add, the repo-level change you were imagining.Suddenly, the AI could help:Scaffold new features end to endInterpret GitHub issues and create PRsGenerate files and connect systemsMove beyond code to thetask behind the codeThis changed the relationship. The AI stopped waiting for you to act\u2014and started meeting you at the level ofintent.\u201cBefore code comes intent. Before pull requests come words.\u201d\u2014 Don SymeThis was a massive unlock. Code became not just the destination, but part of a dynamic conversation between you, the AI, and the repo.Phase 3: Vibe Coding - From Collaboration to Delegation (2025)Whether it\u2019s an AI suggesting a line of code, refactoring a module, or generating an entire app from scratch\u2014the interface is the same:language.You describe what you want. The machine figures out how to make it happen.It\u2019s allvibe coding, as Andrej Karpathy aptly stated:\u201cYou don\u2019t write code; you vibe with the system until it gives you what you want.\u201dBut here\u2019s the important axis:SWE-Agents=collaborative vibe codingYou co-create. You review. You guide the agent through complex workflows across your codebase.App generators=delegated vibe codingYou hand off the task entirely. You prompt once. The AI returns a product. You may or may not ever see the code.Both are powered by prompting.Both abstract away syntax.Both change what \u201ccoding\u201d means.But they differ inintentandcontrol.\ud83e\udde0 Collaborative Vibe CodingUsed in SWE-agents likeDevinorClaude Code, or in chat-oriented IDEs likeWindsurf(with features likeCascade):Modify existing systemsChain reasoning stepsKeep you in the loopGreat for common problems, boilerplate and architecture-aware changesYou stay close. You edit, refine, redirect.You're still engineering, just with superpowers.\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Delegated Vibe CodingUsed in full-app tools likeSparkorLovable:Start from zeroOutput full-stack codebasesGive you a live preview or deploy-ready buildIdeal for simple MVPs, demosor UI prototypesYou hand it off. You react to the result.You\u2019re product shaping, not engineering line-by-line.The distinction isn\u2019t technical\u2014it\u2019s relational.Are you pairing with the AI or managing it like an intern?That\u2019s the real evolution. And it\u2019s still early.In the next wave, we\u2019ll likely see hybrid modes emerge:You delegate first, then switch to collaborateThe AI scaffolds an app, then becomes your agent in the repoTeams work with AI in real-time sessions\u2014pair programming becomes pairorchestrationVibe coding is just the start.What we\u2019re really learning is how to collaborate with machines.So\u2026 Why Is AI-Assisted Coding Taking Over?Because it compresses the loop between thought and execution.Because it augments capability without waiting for perfection.Because it makes developers feel like magicians again, where intent and impact are tightly coupled.It doesn\u2019t replace the craft. It reshapes it.Final Thought: This Is Just the BeginningAI-assisted development isn't a product feature. It's aparadigm shift. The IDE is becoming acollaborative space, not a solo sandbox. The next generation of developers will build faster\u2014but only if we teach them to think deeply, question outputs, and remain thehuman in the loop.The future belongs to those who know how tothink with machines, not just type faster.I\u2019ve lived through many shifts\u2014from CLI compilers and manuals to IDEs with autocomplete and now, collaborative agents. But this one feels different. This one feels like the first time we\u2019re coding withsomeoneinstead ofsomething.Let\u2019s vibe forward.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

Passive use leads to automation bias, but iteration and refinement unlock value and creativity. AI isn't an autopilot. It is a thought partner! The more we engage, the better our results.Travis FrisingerMar 9, 2025\u20222 min readAI\u2019s potential isn\u2019t unlocked through automation. Instead it\u2019s unlocked through engagement. The more we iterate, the more value and creativity we uncover.I never planned on studying my ChatGPT interactions in depth, but after thousands of sessions, I began noticing clear patterns\u2014both promising and worrisome. Sometimes, ChatGPT was a brilliant thought partner, sparking new ideas and refining my thinking. Other times, I fell into the trap of automation bias, accepting answers without a second thought.The AI Decision Loop: A Framework for Smarter GenAI UseTo understand these patterns, I analyzed 2,500 of my own conversations and developed a framework I call theAI Decision Loop\u2014a five-step process to maximize AI\u2019s benefits while avoiding its pitfalls:Frame the Decision Context\u2013 Define constraints, assumptions, and the problem.AI Output Generation & Thought Partnership\u2013 Treat AI as a collaborator, not a magic box.Apply Human Judgment\u2013 Challenge AI\u2019s responses, ask for justification.Verify & Validate\u2013 Fact-check for reliability, especially in high-stakes tasks.Refine & Iterate\u2013 Learn from interactions, improve prompts, and automate selectively.AI Decision LoopThis loop mirrors principles from Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming, underscoring the value of iterative refinement and structured engagement over blind acceptance. For a more in-depth exploration of each step, complete with nuanced insights and practical examples, check out thefull paper.Key Findings from 2500 ConversationsHere are some of the biggest takeaways from my analysis:34% of the time, I exited after Stage 1, showing potential automation bias.74% of the time, I exhibited pairing behaviorwith the AI, engaging in back-and-forth refinement.63% of the time, I demonstrated AI-driven decision-making, meaning I used AI as a co-pilot rather than an autopilot.Only 28% of the time did I use AI to critique its own work or mine, highlighting a missed opportunity for deeper collaboration.When I followed the full AI Decision Loop, my results were significantly better\u2014clearer ideas and better insights.These structured engagement behaviors strongly correlate with higher loop completion rates. The high success rates observed in AI partnership (74%) and AI critique (98%) suggest that structured collaboration may lead to more refined results.The Paradox of AI-Assisted ThinkingAI makes iteration easy, yet its convenience tempts us to shortcut the process. This \u201cstrange loop\u201d of AI-assisted thinking can either amplify our intelligence through rigorous collaboration or degrade it into passive automation if we choose to not engage.The TakeawayAI doesn\u2019t inherently make us smarter, but our structured engagement does. By actively collaborating with AI, we turn it from a mere tool into an adaptive partner that evolves with our thinking. This is not about letting AI run on autopilot; it is about harnessing its power to augment our abilities.In knowledge work, software development, and decision-making, moving beyond passive consumption to embrace a structured, iterative dialogue is key.Augmentation over automation is not just a philosophy, it is the path to unlocking AI as a true force multiplier.Take a moment to reflect on your own interactions with AI.

Most AI tools still demand large amounts of effort. This post explores how GenAI must evolve to provide true utility, removing friction and integrating smoothly into everyday workflows.Travis FrisingerMar 4, 2025\u20225 min readAI experiences should be as seamless as a touchless car washI thought of this the other day while getting my car washed. As I sat there waiting, I realized how effortless the entire experience had become. What used to be a manual, labor-intensive task had been refined through automation into something simple:put money in, drive forward, and wait.No complex steps, no extra effort, just a system that works.It made me think: why doesn\u2019t AI feel this seamless? And what would it take to get there?Most AI tools today still require too much effort with tweaking prompts, refining outputs, and adapting to the AI rather than the other way around. If AI is going to deliver real utility, it needs to evolve the same way car washes did. It should be frictionless, adaptive, and truly useful without requiring constant manual adjustment.This sparked the idea ofThe Touchless Car Wash Approach to GenAI, a set of guiding principles for designing AI that integrates effortlessly into workflows, delivering value without extra cognitive load.If we can automate something as complex as cleaning a car down to a simple drive-through experience, why can\u2019t AI do the same for knowledge work?The Core IdeaA truly touchless GenAI experience should remove the cognitive and operational friction of AI adoption. Instead of forcing users to adapt to AI, the AI should integrate effortlessly into workflows, delivering value without requiring extra effort. The key is autonomy, personalization, and intelligence, much like a touchless car wash that adapts to each vehicle\u2019s needs with minimal user input.What GenAI Can Learn from a Touchless Car WashImagine pulling into a touchless car wash. You don\u2019t have to scrub, rinse, or even step out of your vehicle. The system scans your car, adapts to its shape and delivers an optimized cleaning experience with minimal effort on your part.Now, contrast this with most AI-powered products today.You often need to fine-tune prompts just to get a useful response.The AI isn\u2019t context-aware, forcing you to re-enter the same details repeatedly.Outputs require significant manual refinement, reducing efficiency instead of enhancing it.This is the gap in AI today. AI products should work for the user, not the other way around.To achieve this, GenAI products must be frictionless, intelligent, and seamlessly integrated. Below are ten key guiding principles for building high-value AI products, inspired by the simplicity and efficiency of a touchless car wash.10 Principles for Touchless GenAI1. Minimize Friction, Maximize Utility\u2705 A touchless car wash doesn\u2019t ask you to lather your own soap. AI shouldn\u2019t ask users to do extra work either.Great AI should feel effortless. Users shouldn\u2019t have to craft perfect prompts, manually format responses, or toggle endless settings to get a useful result.\ud83d\udd39Example:Instead of requiring precise prompting, an AI assistant should actively clarify vague requests, automatically rephrase poorly structured inputs, and adjust settings based on past interactions.2. Deliver Instant, High-Impact Results\u2705 A good car wash cleans your car fast. A good AI product delivers immediate value.Users should see instant, meaningful impact without needing extensive onboarding or training. AI should accelerate workflows, not create more steps.\ud83d\udd39Example:Instead of just summarizing meeting notes, AI should generate actionable next steps, draft follow-up emails, and even propose project updates in real time.3. Be Context-Aware and Adaptive\u2705 A touchless car wash adjusts for different car sizes and surface materials. AI should be just as adaptive.GenAI should understand context, not just at a prompt level but across workflows and long-term interactions. It should anticipate needs, remember preferences, and tailor outputs dynamically.\ud83d\udd39Example:A GenAI writing assistant that adapts to your tone and style over time instead of generating generic, one-size-fits-all content.4. Prioritize Actionability Over Novelty\u2705 A car wash doesn\u2019t just spray soap for show. It ensures the car is actually clean.Too many AI tools focus on \"impressive\" outputs rather than usable results. AI should move beyond information retrieval and novelty to deliver next-step actionability.\ud83d\udd39Example:Instead of simply analyzing a dataset, a GenAI system should surface insights, recommend strategic actions, and automate reporting to reduce cognitive load on users.5. Close the AI-User Feedback Loop\u2705 The best car washes improve their process based on customer needs. AI should do the same.AI shouldn\u2019t require users to explicitly provide feedback to improve. It should learn from implicit signals such as which outputs get edited, accepted, or ignored and refine itself accordingly.\ud83d\udd39Example:An AI coding assistant that learns from your corrections and adapts its suggestions without forcing you to manually re-train it.6. Ensure Explainability and Trustworthiness\u2705 A car wash doesn\u2019t hide what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s transparent about the process. AI should be too.Users need to trust AI outputs without spending time fact-checking every response. AI should provide explainability, confidence levels, and sources when relevant.\ud83d\udd39Example:Instead of just giving an answer, AI should cite sources, highlight reasoning, and provide alternative perspectives when uncertainty is high.7. Make AI Work for the User, Not the Other Way Around\u2705 You don\u2019t have to change your car to fit a car wash. AI should fit seamlessly into your workflow.AI should adapt to human workflows rather than forcing people to learn a new system. A great AI experience integrates fluidly into existing tools, processes, and environments.\ud83d\udd39Example:An AI-powered knowledge assistant that automatically enhances documents, spreadsheets, or presentations rather than requiring users to jump into a separate AI tool.8. Emphasize Collaboration Over Replacement\u2705 A car wash doesn\u2019t replace the driver. It just makes their life easier.AI should augment and empower humans, not aim for full automation where human judgment is still valuable. The best AI products are co-pilots, not replacements.\ud83d\udd39Example:A brainstorming AI that asks clarifying questions and refines ideas rather than just generating content with no context or critical thought.9. Maintain Ethical and Privacy-First AI Design\u2705 Just like car washes use eco-friendly water systems, AI should be built responsibly.Trustworthy AI is privacy-conscious, bias-aware, and designed with user control in mind. Ethical design isn\u2019t an afterthought. It\u2019s fundamental to adoption and long-term success.\ud83d\udd39Example:AI that processes as much data locally as possible, minimizes personal data collection, and allows users to control what AI learns from them.10. Build for Continuous, Effortless Improvement\u2705 A great car wash keeps getting better. AI should too.AI products shouldn\u2019t be static. They should continuously learn, refine, and improve in a way that feels natural and invisible to the user.\ud83d\udd39Example:A personal AI assistant that remembers past conversations, improves recommendations based on long-term engagement, and proactively suggests better workflows over time.The Future of GenAI Is TouchlessIf GenAI products truly embraced the touchless car wash mindset, they would become frictionless, intelligent, and seamlessly valuable.We wouldn\u2019t have to fight with prompts, correct AI mistakes, or struggle to integrate AI into our workflows. Instead, AI would simply work, providing context-aware, real-time assistance that enhances our productivity and creativity effortlessly.The future of AI isn\u2019t about doing more to get AI to work.It\u2019s about removing work entirely so AI delivers value without friction.The best AI feels like magic. It\u2019s time to build AI that disappears into the background so humans can stay in the foreground.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

It was simple\u2014just a starting point, more of an experiment than a statement. At the time, I wasn\u2019t sure where this journey would lead, but I knew one thing: writing forces clarity.Over the past year, this blog has become more than just a collection of thoughts. It\u2019s been a space to explore ideas, challenge assumptions, and document the evolving landscape of AI, engineering, and strategy. Looking back, I can see how much has changed\u2014not just in the world of technology, but in my own thinking. I feel like I\u2019m pushing the boundaries of thought, sensing the need to discuss topics just as they become relevant to the larger community.Growth in Writing, Thinking, and DirectionWriting regularly has a way of revealing patterns in thought. What started as occasional posts on AI and engineering has turned into a broader exploration of AI literacy, strategy, and the hidden challenges of working with AI in real-world applications. Each post has pushed me to refine my ideas, forcing me to articulate concepts that might otherwise remain vague.Beyond writing, this year has been about action\u2014building projects, engaging in deep conversations, and pushing forward in areas that matter. From technical deep dives to AI governance discussions, I\u2019ve found that the more I write, the more I engage with others who share similar interests. Writing has become a tool not just for thinking, but for connection.Looking Forward: The Next YearAs I look ahead, the next chapter of this journey is clear: turning these insights into a three-part book series calledNavigating AI. This series will cover everything from AI literacy for knowledge workers, to engineering agent based systems, to executive strategy - all while leveraging GenAI as a force multiplier for teams.This blog has laid the groundwork, and now it\u2019s time to dive deeper. Expect more explorations of how GenAI is reshaping work, more reflections on building with GenAI, and more practical insights into harnessing GenAI\u2019s potential at every level.If the past year has taught me anything, it\u2019s that writing isn\u2019t just about documenting what I already know\u2014it\u2019s about pushing myself to see what I haven\u2019t yet considered.

True value lies in leadership-driven strategies\u2014empowering employees, enhancing decision-making, and fostering innovation through governance, training, and clear objectives, not just metrics.Travis FrisingerFeb 17, 2025\u20222 min readBridging GenAI and Business Strategy: Unlocking Value Through Leadership and Strategic Implementation.The conversation around Generative AI (GenAI) ROI feels stuck. While traditional tools like Excel or ERP systems had clear, quantifiable benefits, GenAI's  value often feels abstract and elusive. The irony? The effort required to measure GenAI\u2019s impact can often offset the very gains it delivers. Do we need DORA for GenAI?The Paradox of GenAI ROIMeasuring the return on investment for GenAI in knowledge work is like trying to capture wind in a bottle. The process of metricizing GenAI usage\u2014tracking time saved, cognitive load reduced, or quality improved\u2014often consumes more resources than the GenAI itself saves. This paradox isn't new; similar challenges emerged during Agile transformations and the digitization of creative work.The Real Value of GenAI in Knowledge WorkGenAI is not just about automating tasks; it's about augmenting human thought, creativity, and decision-making. Its value lies in the unseen, and unlocking this value depends on leadership and governance:Faster Iteration:GenAI accelerates brainstorming, drafting, and revising when leaders encourage experimentation.Deeper Insights:GenAI tools synthesize vast information quickly when governance ensures quality standards.Cognitive Load Reduction:GenAI handles repetitive tasks, freeing humans for higher-order thinking when training empowers them to use GenAI effectively.Rethinking GenAI ROI: A Leadership-Driven ApproachInstead of seeking precision, what if we embraced leadership-driven direction?GenAI Enablement Index:Leadership-defined survey-based scores reflecting perceived GenAI augmentation.Operational Observations:Leaders tracking shorter meetings, fewer of them, faster decision-making, and smoother project flows.Anomaly Detection:Leadership monitoring fewer bottlenecks or faster turnaround as indicators of GenAI value.This approach mirrors how we measure strategic initiatives\u2014focusing on governance, policy, and vision rather than granular metrics.From ROI to Competitive Edge Through LeadershipThe real measure of GenAI in knowledge work is not time saved but opportunity unlocked through strong governance and policy. Organizations that empower employees with GenAI through training, clear guidelines, and room for experimentation will outpace those stuck in the measurement trap.A Leadership-Driven Model for GenAI MeasurementA three-tier framework could help:Operational Efficiency:Leadership ensuring GenAI reduces workload bottlenecks.Cognitive Amplification:Governance driving GenAI to expand thinking and decision capacity.Strategic Leverage:Policy enabling GenAI to open new opportunities or markets.This model encourages companies to experiment with GenAI under strong leadership without getting bogged down by impossible metrics, aligning with thought leaders like Cassie Kozyrkov, who emphasizes leadership\u2019s role in defining GenAI value.Strategic ImplementationImplementing GenAI successfully requires more than just governance; it demands a holistic strategy that includes:Data Infrastructure:Ensuring data quality, accessibility, and integration across systems.Employee Training:Providing continuous learning opportunities for employees to enhance GenAI literacy and leverage GenAI tools effectively.Cross-Functional Collaboration:Encouraging collaboration between technical and non-technical teams to identify GenAI opportunities, starting with small, iterative efforts. Invest in essential tools and training to prototype and explore solutions, then scale development once clear value is demonstrated.Iterative Deployment:Rolling out GenAI solutions in phases, gathering feedback, and continuously improving through agile methods.Clear Objectives:Defining specific goals for GenAI initiatives, aligned with broader business strategies to ensure relevance and impact.This strategic implementation ensures that GenAI initiatives are sustainable, adaptable, and aligned with business goals, making the most of GenAI's potential.In the end, the GenAI value dilemma isn't about proving every minute saved; it's about recognizing that in an age of endless right answers, the true ROI lies in leadership\u2019s ability to set policy, empower people, and seize opportunities before anyone else does.References:Kozyrkov, C.

Is Chat-Assisted Programming (CHAP) the New VBA?Excel empowered business users with macros and VBA\u2014now, ChatGPT and CHAP (Chat-Assisted Programming) are the next evolution. CHAP enables natural-language automation, bridging the gap between power users and engineers. Could CHAP be the new VBA for AI-driven workflows?Travis FrisingerFeb 10, 2025\u20227 min readThe Future of Automation: A Chatbot 'Coding' with Natural Language\u2014Is This the New Excel for Power Users?For decades, Excel has been the go-to tool for business power users. Whether analyzing large data sets, generating pivot tables, or building complex financial models, expert \u201cExcel jockeys\u201d have tackled tasks that once required dedicated developers.Macros andVBA (Visual Basic for Applications)further empowered these users, allowing them to automate processes, customize workflows, and transform spreadsheets into powerful mini-applications. If Excel democratized data manipulation, VBA was the secret sauce that enabled automation at scale.Now,ChatGPT and other Large Language Model (LLM)-based assistantsare emerging as the next universal tool\u2014one that goes beyond numbers to generate text, write code, summarize documents, and integrate with APIs. If ChatGPT is today\u2019s equivalent of Excel in terms of mass adoption and versatility, then a new form of\u201cCHAP\u201d (Chat-Assisted Programming)could be the modern analog to VBA\u2014enabling users to automate workflows through natural-language conversation instead of traditional coding.In Other Words\u2026CHAP=the art of using dialog via prompting to create software at the level VBA once provided to Excel users.Let\u2019s explore how this shift could transform the role of power users and where the \u201cLLM Curve of Impact\u201d might apply in a business context.Excel, the Original Business PlaygroundHow Excel Changed the Game for Power UsersExcel wasn\u2019t just a spreadsheet tool; it was agateway. It lowered the barrier to data manipulation and mild programming. Suddenly, you didn\u2019t need to write a compiled language or be a full-time developer to automate daily tasks or produce meaningful data insights.Formulasgave logic-building capabilities without \u201creal code.\u201dPivot tableslet you slice and dice data interactively.Macros and VBAkicked things up a notch, allowing repeated actions to be recorded, customized, and shared.The Rise of the \u201cExcel Jockey\u201dEnter the businesspower user\u2014the finance analyst, operations manager, or project coordinator who mastered Excel. They might not have had a formal CS degree, but they made Excel sing. Their \u201chacky\u201d macros could handle data merges, produce financial dashboards, or automate entire workflows. For many companies, these Excel-based solutions became mission-critical \u201cmini apps.\u201dThe key is how skillfully you can orchestrate the LLM to do complex tasks\u2014just like how advanced Excel users wrote elaborate macros.Meet the New Player: ChatGPT (and Other LLMs)Why ChatGPT Feels Like Excel\u2019s Second ComingChatGPT offers a similar kind of democratization\u2014but for natural language and code generation. Instead of memorizing formula syntax, you talk to a chatbot:\u201cShow me how to solve problem XYZ.\u201d\u201cWrite a snippet of code that does ABC.\u201d\u201cSummarize these documents and highlight key insights.\u201dFor the everyday user, ChatGPT is animmediate productivity tool\u2014they can produce polished emails, generate marketing copy, or quickly draft templates. As with Excel, you don\u2019t need to be a full-stack developer. You just need to know how to phrase your question or request effectively.How Power Users Benefit\u201cExcel jockeys\u201d often handle cross-functional tasks: analyzing data, building presentations, gleaning insights, and combining them into actionable steps. With ChatGPT:They canask for data transformationsdirectly. (E.g., \u201cParse these text strings into structured data.\u201d)They cangenerate content(like writing a brief or blog post from bullet points) far faster.They canprototype codeor scripts for more advanced automations without diving deep into programming docs.But as with Excel, there\u2019s always a next-level step: customizing and automating these interactions. That\u2019s where something akin toVBAmight appear\u2026Introducing CHAP (Chat-Assisted Programming)From Macros to Conversational \u201cMacros\u201dIf ChatGPT is our modern-day Excel, then a 'CHAP' layer is how we extend its functionality\u2014just like how power users leveraged VBA to go beyond basic macros. Instead of writing VBA inside Excel, you give structured prompts and instructions to an LLM, orchestrating tasks across various apps and data sources.A simple example might be:CHAP_Script:\n  - Load \"customer_feedback.csv\"\n  - Remove duplicate entries\n  - Categorize feedback sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative\n  - Count the number of responses in each category\n  - Generate a simple bar chart showing sentiment distribution\n  - Save the chart as \"feedback_summary.png\"How CHAP Aligns with VBA\u2019s Role in ExcelFeatureVBA Macros (Excel)CHAP (LLM-Based)How Users InteractWrite VBA scripts manuallyUse structured prompts (natural language)Automation ScopeExcel tasks (data, UI, reports)Any software/API (data processing, UI, automation)Code VisibilityUser must write & manage codeCode is abstracted away but existsWho Benefits?Power users who know VBAPower users comfortable with AI tools and automation platformsThe Role of Tooling in CHAPFor CHAP to be effective, tooling that abstracts away complexity while providing execution and feedback mechanisms is crucial. Platforms likeWindsurf, which can run commands, read errors, and iteratively correct them, are essential to making CHAP workflows seamless. These tools bridge the gap between natural language automation and robust, error-free execution, ensuring that business users can rely on AI-driven automation without needing to debug raw code.Key Takeaway:CHAP still generates code, but users don\u2019t have to write or even see it\u2014unless they want to. Just like VBA macros helped power users automate workflows in Excel without deep programming skills, CHAP enables natural-language-based automation across a broader range of applications.No explicit \u201cVB-like\u201d syntax\u2014just step-by-step instructions in natural language. Under the hood, there could be more advanced logic or code, but from the user\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s all about describing what you want in plain English (or any language, really).The Power of OrchestrationThe big innovation is that LLM-based automation can reachbeyondthe confines of spreadsheets. It can:Pull from APIs,Interact with databases,Compose emails,Even handle logic or conditionals (\u201cif user is inactive for 90 days, do X\u201d).So, \u201cCHAP\u201d is less aboutexplicitly writing scriptsand more aboutdialogue-driven software creation\u2014the next evolution of macros.The LLM Curve of Impact\u2014Revisited for Power UsersSource:https://serce.me/posts/2025-02-07-the-llm-curve-of-impact-on-software-engineersIn a recent post about the \u201cLLM Curve of Impact,\u201d it looked at how different engineer levels react to ChatGPT. But if we replace \u201cjunior engineer\u201d with \u201cbusiness power user,\u201d the core idea still applies:Business Power Usersoften see a huge immediateboostfrom ChatGPT. Like how Excel macros supercharged them, LLMs fill knowledge gaps instantly and let them accomplish tasks previously out of scope.Middle-of-the-Road Usersmight hit a \u201cDanger Zone\u201d of sorts if they don\u2019t upgrade their approach. They know enough to use ChatGPT but don\u2019t quite structure prompts or chain tasks effectively.Veteran \u201cExcel Jockeys\u201dwho adopt CHAP could end up with thehighest level of impact.They know their domain inside out and can design robust workflows that harness the AI\u2019s capabilities\u2014building entire solutions from natural language \u201crecipes.\u201dThe key is how skillfully you can orchestrate the LLM to do complex tasks\u2014just like how advanced Excel users wrote elaborate macros. As in the old days, you either remain a casual spreadsheet user or learn the magic of macros. Today, you can remain a casual prompt user or embrace \u201cChat-Assisted Programming.\u201dWhy CHAP Might Be the New VBASimilaritiesEntry Point for Power Users:VBA let non-developers build real automation. CHAP likewise empowers people who aren\u2019t full-time devs to create mini-apps and workflows.Extending a Popular Tool:VBA extended Excel; CHAP extends ChatGPT or any LLM interface.Bridging the Gap:Both solutions fill that space between \u201ccasual usage\u201d and \u201cproduction-level software,\u201d enabling quick prototypes or departmental applications.DifferencesNatural Language First:VBA was still code. CHAP (in concept) uses prompts, so the user\u2019s instructions read more like conversation than lines of code.Broad Ecosystem:While VBA was mostly tied to Excel or Microsoft Office, LLM-based CHAP can integrate across the web, cloud services, internal APIs, etc.AI-Enhanced Logic:CHAP isn\u2019t just automating steps\u2014it can also interpret context, generate text, and make suggestions in real-time.Potential Danger Zone and OpportunitiesDanger ZoneJust like there was a risk of \u201cFrankenstein spreadsheets\u201d in Excel\u2014overly complex macros that no one else could maintain\u2014LLM-based workflows could become messy or insecure if not implemented carefully:Over-reliance on\u201cblack box\u201dAI can lead to mistakes or compliance issues.Using incomplete data sets or prompt engineering can produce misleading outputs.OpportunityFor those \u201cExcel jockeys\u201d who embrace structured prompt engineering (or \u201cCHAP\u201d), there\u2019s a chance to become the go-to solution provider again. Organizations will always need folks who can:Translate business problemsinto structured prompts or scripts.Validate the AI\u2019s outputfor accuracy and reliability.Documentthese new \u201cmacro flows\u201d so others can adopt and maintain them.This is how the old \u201cExcel wizard\u201d in an accounting department turned into an indispensable resource. Now, you can do it in a far broader context, bridging multiple systems and departments.A Vision for the FutureImagine a world where the business power user sits down to an AI interface and simply says:\u201cGive me a weekly pivot on our sales data, highlight the top 10% customers by volume, draft an email for each rep with an individualized summary, and log any anomalies in a shared dashboard.\u201dAnd the AI\u2013powered CHAP system does it, possibly even optimizing each step:Fetchingdata from a live sales database.Summarizingresults with context-aware analysis.Generatingpersonalized email text per account rep.Notifyingrelevant channels in Slack or Teams.No explicit coding is required, just well-crafted instructions. Sure, under the hood it\u2019s a combination of scripts, APIs, and advanced logic. But the power user is still free to refine the process in everyday language, reminiscent of how they once recorded Excel macros.Conclusion & Next StepsChatGPT or LLM-based chatbotshave the potential to become the new \u201cExcel\u201d\u2014the place where business users and power users gather to quickly get things done. And if that analogy holds, it won\u2019t be long before we see a \u201cCHAP\u201d (Chat-Assisted Programming) ecosystem\u2014a new generation ofconversational macrosornatural-language scripting.How You Can PrepareExperiment with Prompt Engineering:Learn how to phrase questions and tasks so an LLM can best help you.Think in \u201cWorkflows\u201d:Start identifying repetitive tasks or data flows that could be partially automated using chat-based interactions.Balance Trust and Verification:AI can be powerful, but always maintain checks and balances\u2014especially when dealing with critical data or external communications.In short, don\u2019t be surprised if tomorrow\u2019s \u201cExcel jockey\u201d wields an AI \u201cmacro language\u201d in a Slack channel or web interface. The skills that once made you a wizard with PivotTables and VBA can translate directly into crafting unstoppable chat-assisted workflows.Thanks for reading\u2014and welcome to the age of CHAP, where natural language just might become the new VBA.Further ReadingThe LLM Curve of Impact:For insights on how AI tools affect different experience levels.The evolution of Macros and VBA in Excel:A historical perspective on how simple recorded macros evolved into VBA-powered business-critical workflows.Author\u2019s NoteEmbracing LLM-based tools doesn\u2019t diminish the necessity of strong process knowledge and domain expertise paired with solid engineering skills. Just like the best Excel experts were those who deeply understood both the data and the tasks, the next generation of \u201cCHAP experts\u201d will be the ones who can blend AI\u2019s power with practical, real-world business logic.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

If their breakthroughs hold up in real-world adoption, they coulddisrupt the dominance of closed-source AI giantslike OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.That\u2019s why the recent release ofDeepSeek-V3 and R1, two new AI models from aChinese company, has shaken the industry. DeepSeek\u2019s claims?\u2705Comparable performance to top-tier AI modelslike Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\u2705A fraction of the cost\u2014reportedly trained for just $5M instead of hundreds of millions.\u2705Completely open-source, unlike the secretive models from OpenAI and Anthropic.While some hail this asa revolutionary moment, others\u2014likeAnthropic\u2019s CEO\u2014argue it\u2019s justan expected step in AI\u2019s cost reduction curve. So, which is it?What Makes DeepSeek\u2019s Models Special?DeepSeek\u2019s latest models introducethree major innovationsthat could reshape AI development.1. Cost-Efficient Training and Hardware UtilizationDeepSeek claims it trainedV3 for just $5M, a fraction of the$100M-$1B typically spent by OpenAI and Anthropicon similar models.This was achieved through:Smarter dataset selection, reducing redundant training data.More efficient compute usage, optimizing resource allocation.Mixture of Experts (MoE), which activates only necessary parts of the model per query.Reality Check:The $5M claim is impressive, but there is skepticism thatDeepSeek still relied on 50,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs (~$1B worth of hardware).If True, the real breakthrough isn\u2019t in how little they spent\u2014buthow efficiently they trained at this scale.2. Mixture of Experts (MoE) for Smarter, Cheaper AIMost large modelsactivate all their parametersfor every response, making them expensive to run.DeepSeek-V3uses MoE, selectively activatingonly the most relevant portionsof the model per query\u2014reducing costs while maintaining high performance.While MoE itselfisn\u2019t new(Google and OpenAI have experimented with it),DeepSeek is the first to scale it effectively and open-source it, making the approach more accessible than ever.Reality Check:While MoE has been touted as a game-changer for AI efficiency, it\u2019s never been fully adopted due tocomplexity and latency concerns. DeepSeek\u2019s success, however, signals thatMoE might be hitting its stride at scale, offering a viable challenge to theresource-hungry dense models. That said, if real-world applications exposelatency or quality issues, dense models may still hold the upper hand.3. Open-Source Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) LearningDeepSeek-R1learns step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL), rather than relying on human-curated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training data.This method is similar to OpenAI\u2019so1 model, but DeepSeek\u2019s true breakthrough is infully open-sourcing not just the model, but the entire training process, allowing anyone to replicate and refine it.Reality Check:OpenAI and others have paved the way with CoT reasoning, but their methods are locked behind closed doors. DeepSeek\u2019s move to release afully transparent, RL-trained CoT modelis agame-changing leap for AI accessibility. But open-sourcing doesn\u2019t guarantee success\u2014without a thriving developer community, the model couldstagnate.

From mastering prompts to dealing with uncertainty, I explore practical hurdles and mindset shifts to unlock AI's true potential.Travis FrisingerJan 3, 2025\u202212 min readCollaborating with AI: Unlocking Creativity and Productivity in the Modern WorkplaceAs a technologist and product thinker, I use AI daily\u2014not just as a productivity tool, but as a collaborator. Whether it\u2019s brainstorming solutions to complex engineering challenges, refining a product strategy, or even crafting POCs to explore a product concept and the related engineering, AI has become a trusted partner in my work. It enables me to think faster, dig deeper, and deliver more value across teams.But in conversations with peers across engineering, product, and business functions, I\u2019ve noticed something striking: many people hesitate to use AI, even when it could clearly help. It\u2019s not just about technical hurdles like knowing the right prompts or choosing the best tools\u2014though those are challenges, too.The deeper issue is less tangible but much more pervasive: the feeling that using AI somehow undermines the value of our work.In technology and product roles, value is often tied to innovation\u2014creating elegant technical solutions, devising impactful product ideas, or delivering results through effort and expertise. AI changes this dynamic. When used effectively, it can reduce the time spent solving problems or even suggest ideas we might not have considered ourselves. This can leave people wondering: If AI is doing the heavy lifting, what\u2019s my contribution?AI shifts our focus away from routine or time-intensive tasks and toward the creative, strategic, and impactful work that drives progress.This perceived tension between AI\u2019s capabilities and personal value is one of the most significant barriers to adoption I\u2019ve encountered.It\u2019s not about mastering tools; it\u2019s about rethinking how we define professional worth in an AI-driven world.Let's break down both the obvious and non-obvious barriers to AI adoption\u2014especially as they relate to technology and product\u2014and explore how we can reframe AI\u2019s role to unlock its full potential.The obvious challenges to AI adoptionThe initial hype around AI adoption is beginning to cool, as revealed in theFall 2024 Workforce Index by Slack. Despite the widespread awareness of AI's potential, organizations are facing hurdles in turning that awareness into consistent usage. While some individuals and teams integrate AI into their workflows seamlessly, many others struggle with the basics, leading to lower adoption rates.Source: \u201cThe Fall 2024 Workforce Index,\u201d Slack, August 2024.This disparity highlights the gap between understanding AI\u2019s capabilities and effectively leveraging them. Below, we explore the foundational challenges that prevent AI from becoming a universal part of daily workflows.1. You Have to Be Good at PromptingCrafting effective prompts is an iterative skill, much like debugging code or refining a product spec. Poor prompts often lead to irrelevant or unusable outputs, discouraging further experimentation. A study of 5,000 knowledge workers found that only 10% were skilled at prompting. The remaining 90% often receive poor outputs, reinforcing the perception that AI is not worth their time.The Big PictureThe conversational interface, powered by LLMs like ChatGPT, represents a foundational leap in AI\u2019s evolution. Unlike early rule-based chatbots limited by rigid scripts, modern conversational tools offer unprecedented flexibility and interactivity. These interfaces enable users to engage with AI intuitively through everyday language, removing technical barriers and democratizing access to advanced capabilities.By lowering the barrier to entry, today\u2019s AI tools empower both technical and non-technical users to perform complex tasks like data analysis, predictions, and creative brainstorming. This transformation not only streamlines workflows but also sparks new possibilities, making it essential to integrate conversational AI into everyday work.The Path to Unlocking PotentialTo fully harness this potential, teams must learn to craft effective prompts that clearly communicate their goals and needs to the AI. This involves providing specific examples to guide the AI\u2019s response, breaking down complex requests into targeted queries, and iteratively refining prompts based on initial outputs. Developing these skills enables users to unlock AI's flexibility and ensures meaningful, actionable outputs that add value to their workflows.2. You Have to Know When to Use ItUnderstanding which problems are AI-solvable isn\u2019t always intuitive. AI\u2019s capabilities are vast, but applying them effectively requires a clear grasp of its strengths and limitations. Without this understanding, users might either overuse AI for tasks where it adds little value or underuse it for areas where it could significantly improve efficiency and creativity.Key Questions to ConsiderTo determine whether AI is the right tool for a particular task, ask questions like:Should AI be used to debug a code issue?If so, how should it be incorporated\u2014perhaps to identify patterns in logs or suggest possible fixes?Is AI better suited to brainstorm product ideas or conduct market research?It might uncover trends or generate creative directions faster than traditional methods.Can AI add value in generating customer support responses or marketing copy?If yes, how can it align with brand voice and customer expectations?The Role of Specialized ToolsSpecialized tools and vertical AI agents can bridge the gap between raw AI capabilities and specific use cases. For example:IDE Plugins:Assist with code generation, debugging, or refactoring.Roadmap Assistants:Help prioritize features or identify dependencies based on user feedback.Domain-Specific Agents:Tailored solutions for industries like healthcare, legal, or finance, designed to address unique challenges within those fields.While raw conversational AI like ChatGPT offers flexibility, it can feel overwhelming in a blank chat window. Tailored integrations provide structure and guide users toward productive use cases, making it easier to harness AI\u2019s potential effectively.Staying Focused on the ProblemIt\u2019s essential not to lose sight of the original product or business problem that brought you to AI in the first place. Tools and technology are only as valuable as the outcomes they drive. Ensuring that AI solutions remain grounded in real-world needs prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment with organizational goals.3. You Have to Remember to Use ItIt seems counterintuitive\u2014if AI is valuable, why do we sometimes forget to use it? The reality is that integrating any new tool into a workflow requires habit formation. Even early adopters can overlook AI, especially when it\u2019s not yet a natural part of their problem-solving process.Intentionally Incorporating AI into WorkflowsTo make AI a consistent part of your toolkit, integrate it deliberately into daily tasks. Examples include:Sprint Planning:Use AI to brainstorm ideas, prioritize tasks, or identify dependencies.Documentation:Rely on AI to draft and review product documentation or PRDs, saving time and improving clarity.Debugging:Provide AI with log file snippets or error messages to help narrow down issues and suggest potential solutions.These practices not only make AI more accessible but also encourage experimentation, helping teams discover how best to leverage its capabilities.Instead of focusing solely on short-term metrics, the emphasis should be on AI's transformative potential to enhance creativity, efficiency, and decision-making over time.Finding BalanceFor seasoned users, AI often becomes second nature\u2014a go-to resource for many tasks. However, over-reliance can pose its own challenges. There are times when stepping away from AI and solving a problem directly can yield better results, particularly when deep focus or domain expertise is required.The key is balance: use AI to amplify your efforts without letting it replace critical thinking or creativity. Over time, this balanced approach can help AI evolve from an optional tool into an indispensable partner.4. It\u2019s Hard to Measure AI ROIQuantifying the value AI provides remains a significant challenge for teams. How do you measure the time saved, the quality of outputs, or the broader impact of AI on decision-making? Without clear metrics, it's difficult to justify the investment of time and resources into adopting AI tools.Challenges in Measuring AI ROI1. Time Saved vs. Quality GainedWhile AI can automate repetitive tasks, its true value often lies in improving the quality of work. For example, AI might help generate more creative ideas or uncover insights in data that humans might miss. These qualitative benefits are harder to measure than simple time savings.2. Subjectivity in Perceived ValueDifferent teams may value AI contributions differently. Engineers might focus on debugging speed, while marketing teams prioritize creative outputs. The subjective nature of value can lead to inconsistent ROI measurement across departments.3. Cost of Integration and TrainingThe upfront investment in training teams to use AI tools and integrating these tools into existing workflows can overshadow immediate benefits, making it harder to demonstrate short-term ROI.Strategies to Demonstrate AI ROI1. Define Key Metrics EarlyIdentify what success looks like before integrating AI. Examples include:Reducing time spent on specific tasks (e.g., documentation, debugging).Increasing the number of creative solutions generated during brainstorming sessions.Improving accuracy in repetitive processes like data entry or analysis.2. Use Comparative StudiesTest the same task with and without AI to measure differences in time, quality, or output. For instance:How much faster can a team generate a technical document using AI for summarization?Does AI-assisted code debugging result in fewer bugs in production?3. Log and Analyze Outputs Over TimeCreate a repository of AI outputs and track how they influence decisions or lead to successful outcomes. Examples include:An AI-generated idea that became a key feature in a product.Customer support templates created by AI that led to higher satisfaction scores.4. Monitor Team Feedback and Adoption RatesUse surveys or discussions to gauge how teams feel about AI's impact on their workflows. Higher adoption rates often correlate with perceived value, even if it\u2019s not directly measurable.The Long-Term ViewAI's value may not always be immediately apparent. In many cases, benefits compound over time as teams refine how they use the tools and integrate them more seamlessly into their workflows.This shift to an AI-augmented workflow is comparable to the adoption of DevOps practices or automation in software testing\u2014initial resistance and costs eventually give way to measurable productivity gains and improved outcomes.By embracing a mindset of continuous experimentation and improvement, teams can build a case for AI that transcends traditional ROI models. Instead of focusing solely on short-term metrics, the emphasis should be on AI's transformative potential to enhance creativity, efficiency, and decision-making over time.5. Concerns About Accuracy and TrustAI isn\u2019t always reliable. Its outputs can be inaccurate, incomplete, or biased\u2014often referred to as \"hallucinations.\" These inaccuracies can erode trust, particularly in high-stakes applications like financial analysis, medical diagnostics, or technical decision-making. Ensuring that AI outputs are valid, actionable, and aligned with user needs requires significant oversight.The Role of ValidationValidation is critical for building trust in AI outputs:Technical Validation:Engineers must assess the technical correctness of outputs, especially in areas like code generation or system design, where errors could lead to downstream issues.Alignment with User Needs:Product teams or stakeholders should evaluate whether the outputs meet user expectations and align with intended outcomes or experiences.Interestingly, AI \"hallucinations\" can sometimes be reframed as opportunities for creative exploration. Unexpected or unconventional outputs might spark new ideas or reveal alternative approaches that traditional workflows wouldn\u2019t generate.Skill HighlightEffective AI usage mirrors traditional problem-solving skills:Decompose Challenges:Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components.Iterative Refinement:Continuously refine AI outputs to focus on actionable results.Combine Expertise with AI:Use domain knowledge to validate and contextualize AI suggestions, ensuring outputs are both relevant and practical.These skills are already second nature to experienced engineers and product managers, making them well-equipped to collaborate effectively with AI.The Path ForwardBuilding trust with AI requires a strategic, iterative approach:Start Broad:Use general prompts to explore potential solutions or generate ideas.Refine the Focus:Narrow down the scope to specific aspects of the problem, validating the outputs as you progress.Iterate and Adjust:Continuously refine, test, and contextualize outputs, treating AI as a collaborative partner rather than an infallible authority.This mindset encourages confidence in AI\u2019s capabilities while fostering a collaborative dynamic. Over time, AI becomes a reliable asset for creativity, problem-solving, and decision-making, unlocking its full potential across a range of applications.The non-obvious challenges to AI adoption1. The Value of Original IdeasOriginality is often considered a cornerstone of professional value, especially in tech and product roles. However, ideas generated by AI may feel less valuable simply because they didn\u2019t originate entirely from the individual. This can lead users to downplay or dismiss the contributions AI can bring.Reframing the Narrative:AI should be viewed as a brainstorming partner that expands creative bandwidth, not a competitor for credit. It enhances originality by providing starting points, uncovering blind spots, and suggesting directions that might not have been considered otherwise.The Tool, Not the Creator:Just as computers replaced paper as tools for creation, AI empowers users to work faster and explore ideas more deeply. The partnership between human creativity and AI-generated insights often leads to truly innovative solutions.2. The Value of EffortHard work is deeply ingrained in our sense of professional worth. When AI reduces the amount of effort required, it can feel like cutting corners. This misconception can foster resistance, as people equate effort with value rather than focusing on outcomes.Reframing Effort as Optimization:Effort should focus on optimizing processes and addressing high-value challenges. Just as automation tools freed engineers from repetitive tasks, AI allows teams to spend less time on execution and more on strategy, design, and systems-level thinking.Evolving Knowledge Work:AI elevates knowledge work by enabling faster exploration of abstract concepts and narrowing the landscape of possibilities during problem-solving. This evolution mirrors the broader advancement of technology\u2014freeing us from manual labor to focus on creative and intellectual pursuits.3. Bias Toward PerfectionAI outputs are often imperfect, which can frustrate users. This frustration stems from two assumptions:AI should be perfect because it\u2019s a computer.If AI creates more space for exploration, the output must be perfected.Treat AI as a Junior Collaborator:AI is not a magic wand; it\u2019s more like a junior team member providing rough drafts that require iteration and refinement. Just as you wouldn\u2019t expect perfection from an intern, AI\u2019s outputs are starting points, not finished products.Balancing Exploration and Execution:While AI opens the door to abstract thinking, it\u2019s essential to set boundaries for iteration. Instead of seeking perfection, focus on outputs that meet project goals and move the work forward. Often, imperfection sparks innovation, as unexpected results can lead to new ideas.4. Interdisciplinary MisalignmentAI is often perceived differently across disciplines, leading to conflicting expectations. For example, engineers might emphasize technical feasibility\u2014whether AI can execute a task efficiently and reliably\u2014while product teams may focus on outcomes, such as user satisfaction or business impact. This divergence can create inefficiencies and misaligned priorities, slowing AI adoption.Root Cause:The misalignment often stems from differences in how teams approach problem-solving:Engineers typically break down tasks into discrete, solvable units, focusing on \"how\" the solution works.Product teams prioritize the \"why\"\u2014the overarching goals, user experience, and broader market needs.A Practical Approach to Bridging the Gap:Define Clear Objectives Together:Begin AI projects with cross-functional discussions to align on goals, ensuring technical feasibility and user outcomes are equally prioritized.Collaborate on AI Use Cases:Involve both technical and non-technical teams in selecting and shaping AI applications, from initial concept to implementation.Establish Shared Metrics:Develop success metrics that resonate with all stakeholders, such as reducing user friction (product focus) while maintaining reliability (engineering focus).Moving Toward Unified AI Adoption:The misalignment between disciplines won\u2019t disappear overnight, but creating opportunities for collaboration can significantly reduce friction. Teams that align on goals, communicate effectively, and foster shared accountability are better positioned to leverage AI\u2019s potential and integrate it seamlessly into workflows.How to make this mindset shift1. Realize That Leadership Values Results Over ProcessesLeaders prioritize results and impact over the specific processes used to achieve them. Whether ideas come from AI or traditional brainstorming, what matters most is the value they deliver. Embracing AI as part of your workflow doesn\u2019t undermine your contribution\u2014it amplifies it by enabling better outcomes more efficiently.2. Start with Something Small to Reduce FrictionOne of the biggest hurdles to adopting AI is simply getting started. Begin by applying AI to low-stakes or exploratory tasks where perfection isn\u2019t critical. For instance, use AI to draft initial concepts, brainstorm ideas, or summarize complex information. Starting small builds familiarity and confidence, making it easier to integrate AI into more impactful areas over time.3. Pair AI with Human ExpertiseThink of AI as a teammate that extends your capabilities, not as a replacement. AI excels at generating options, uncovering patterns, or summarizing information, but the final decisions and insights remain yours. Combining AI\u2019s speed and breadth with your unique context and judgment creates a partnership where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.4. Celebrate Small WinsTrack and share successes from using AI\u2014whether it\u2019s saving time, generating a unique idea, or solving a problem faster. Small wins reinforce the value of AI, build trust in its capabilities, and encourage others to experiment with it in their own workflows.5. Normalize AI as a UtilityAI should be viewed as a foundational tool, much like electricity or running water\u2014a resource that enables higher-value work by handling routine or time-intensive tasks. The more seamlessly AI integrates into daily workflows, the more it frees up mental and creative energy for tackling complex challenges and driving innovation.ConclusionLet\u2019s all agree: using AI is not cheating. It\u2019s a productivity optimization tool, much like automation revolutionized manufacturing or software frameworks streamlined application development. These tools didn\u2019t replace human ingenuity\u2014they amplified it, freeing us to focus on higher-order challenges.By partnering with AI, we don\u2019t lose our value; we expand it. AI shifts our energy from routine tasks to creativity, strategy, and impact\u2014the work that defines success in today\u2019s world. Together with AI, we can redefine how we work, solve problems, and innovate. The future of work isn\u2019t about replacement\u2014it\u2019s about collaboration.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

Building on Beowulf clusters and Charm++, they face challenges like routing and aggregation, requiring smarter systems, semantic routing, and dynamic workflows for the future.Travis FrisingerDec 16, 2024\u20225 min readDistributed computing has come a long way since my early days in the industry, whenBeowulf clustersandCharm++were the state of the art. Long before theXen Hypervisorand thecloud revolutionsimplified everything, managing computational workloads across nodes required significant effort, ingenuity, and a healthy tolerance for complexity.Back then, distributed systems solved computation-heavy problems by efficiently sharing workloads across multiple nodes. Today, the rise of AI agents brings a new kind of distributed system\u2014one where intelligence, not just computation, is distributed among collaborative, task-specific agents. These agents collaborate to tackle problems no single system could solve on its own.While the tools and goals have evolved, the core challenges\u2014efficient routing, aggregation, and fault tolerance\u2014remain strikingly familiar. Inspired byBerkeley Artificial Intelligence Research\u2019s (BAIR)recent exploration into Compound AI systems andmy own workwith distributed computing frameworks in the early 2000s, let\u2019s dive into how AI agents are transforming distributed computing and why this new frontier demands innovative solutions.Despite advances in cloud-native systems, AI agents reintroduce classic distributed computing challenges, now infused with AI-specific complexities.What Are AI Agents?Imagine running a company with a team of specialists: a marketing expert, a financial analyst, a designer, and a project manager. Each team member excels in their domain, but it\u2019s the manager who delegates tasks, coordinates efforts, and ensures they\u2019re working toward a common goal. AI agents work in much the same way.In distributed AI systems, these agents are typically task-specific software built around a combination of prompts, a large language model (LLM), and one or more tools. Each agent is designed to perform a specialized function\u2014such as reasoning, perception, language understanding, or decision-making. Working together under the guidance of a coordinating system, these agents collaborate to produce a unified and cohesive result.In essence,AI agentsform the building blocks of modern distributed systems, designed to:Decompose complex problemsinto subtasks handled by specialized agents.Route and aggregate requestsefficiently between agents.Adapt workflows dynamically, assigning tasks to agents based on predefined performance metrics or iterative improvements.A Parallel to Early Distributed ComputingFor those of us who rememberBeowulf clustersand frameworks likeCharm++, the similarities are striking:Beowulf: Revolutionized distributed computing by enabling affordable clusters of commodity hardware. Tasks were divided and conquered, with a focus on high-performance, parallel processing.Charm++: Pioneered the idea ofintelligent task scheduling, where objects could migrate between processors to balance workloads dynamically.Similarly, modern distributed AI systems aim to:Break down workflows into modular, parallelizable components (agents).Dynamically route tasks between agents based on performance and specialization.Balance computational efficiency with the quality of results.Yet, where Beowulf and Charm++ handled deterministic workloads, AI agents must navigate theuncertaintyinherent in machine learning\u2014a fundamentally more challenging landscape.Real-World Applications of AI AgentsTo understand the potential of AI agents, let\u2019s explore some examples already shaping industries:AutoGPT and Agent-based Systems:Tools like AutoGPT illustrate early-stage implementations of AI agents, where models break down tasks and collaborate to combine outputs. While promising, these systems are experimental and lack the robustness of fully integrated multi-agent systems. For example, a travel-planning agent might generate itineraries, another estimate costs, and a third refine the final plan.AI-Driven E-Commerce:In platforms like Amazon, modular AI systems handle tasks such as product recommendations, fraud detection, and inventory updates. While these systems are tightly integrated microservices rather than independent AI agents, they demonstrate the potential of modular workflows driven by task-specific AI components.Multimodal AI Applications:Applications like ChatGPT Vision or Adobe Firefly showcase multimodal processing, where specialized modules handle vision and language tasks. These are foundational steps toward building systems with multiple agents that work independently yet harmoniously.Revisiting the Core Challenges of Distributed ComputingDespite advances in cloud-native systems, AI agents reintroduce classic distributed computing challenges, now infused with AI-specific complexities:Routing RequestsThen: Load balancers directed tasks to nodes in a Beowulf cluster.Now: Requests must be intelligently routed between AI agents, each with unique capabilities and performance profiles.Future Need: Reinforcement learning algorithms to dynamically optimize routing based on agent performance.Result AggregationThen: Systems like MapReduce excelled at combining results from distributed nodes.Now: Distributed AI systems must merge probabilistic and incomplete outputs (e.g., combining text summaries and visual data).Future Need: Semantically-aware aggregation mechanisms for reconciling conflicting outputs.Dynamic OrchestrationThen: Charm++ enabled tasks to migrate dynamically to balance workloads.Now: AI systems must adapt workflows in real time, rerouting tasks or revisiting outputs based on partial results.Future Need: Middleware frameworks to coordinate and manage dynamic workflows for AI agents.Fault ToleranceThen: Redundancy and failover strategies ensured robustness.Now: AI systems must recover from subtle errors, like biased or incorrect outputs from agents.Future Need: Self-healing mechanisms where agents validate and correct one another\u2019s work.From Microservices to AI Agents: The Cloud-Native ConnectionThe cloud-native era transformed distributed computing by introducing tools like Kubernetes, which standardized deployment, scaling, and fault tolerance for microservices. These advances abstracted much of the complexity engineers faced with earlier systems like Beowulf and Charm++. Microservices allowed developers to break down monolithic applications into modular, independent services that could scale dynamically.However,AI agents go beyond microservices, addressing challenges that cloud-native tools were never designed to solve:Contextual Routing: Microservices rely on predefined rules for routing requests, but AI agents require intelligent, context-aware decision-making to assign tasks to the best-suited agent.Adaptive Workflows: While microservices follow linear, static workflows, AI agents collaborate dynamically, adjusting workflows in real-time based on intermediate results or changing goals.Collaborative Learning: Unlike microservices, which perform isolated functions, AI agents have the potential to share knowledge and learn from each other, improving system-wide performance over time.AI agents represent a smarter evolution of distributed computing\u2014where intelligence, not just tasks, is distributed across systems. They build on the foundation of cloud-native tools like Kubernetes but extend their capabilities to handle the dynamic, uncertain, and learning-oriented workflows that define the future of AI-driven systems.Looking Ahead: Distributed IntelligenceAI agents represent a shift from distributingcomputationto distributingintelligence. But this evolution comes with challenges that will define the next decade:Semantic Routing: Systems that understand tasks well enough to route them intelligently.Collaborative Agents: Mechanisms for agents to share insights while respecting data privacy.Middleware for Agents: Robust frameworks to manage agent workflows, akin to Kubernetes for microservices.Edge Intelligence: Moving decision-making closer to users to improve latency and efficiency.Conclusion: A New Frontier, Familiar ProblemsAs someone who recalls debugging Beowulf clusters and experimenting with Charm++, it\u2019s fascinating to see how distributed computing principles are re-emerging in the context of AI. Multi-agent AI systems are complex, messy, and rife with potential\u2014but they\u2019re also a reminder that the foundations we laid in distributed computing still matter.The future of AI isn\u2019t just about bigger models; it\u2019s about smarter systems. And as we tackle these challenges, we\u2019re not so much reinventing the wheel as refining it for a new era.I leave you with this thought: If Beowulf was the DIY revolution of distributed computing, and Kubernetes redefined simplicity in the cloud-native era, what will emerge to shape and define the era of AI agents?AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) highlights a critical challenge: how do we align engineering excellence with user-centric design to create trustworthy, adaptable, and impactful systems?Reflecting on my experiences with distributed systems and data engineering, I came across aLatent Spacearticle introducing the3 Ps of AI UX Design\u2014Presence, Practicality, and Power.These principles resonate deeply with the3 Ps of AI Engineering\u2014Providers, Provenance, and Polyglot,which I\u2019ve developed over years of solving data challenges. Together, these frameworks provide a comprehensive roadmap for creating AI systems that are technically robust, user-focused, and built to last.AI should feel like a utility, not a feature\u2014seamlessly integrated, always present, and ready to assistThe 3 Ps of AI UX Design1. PresencePresence is about making AI a seamless part of the user\u2019s workflow. It should feel like a natural extension of their tools, reducing friction and enabling intuitive adoption. For instance:Code autocomplete tools in IDEs like Copilot or Cursor embed AI directly into the developer\u2019s environment.AI-enhanced writing assistants, such as Grammarly, integrate within email clients and browsers.The goal is clear: users shouldn\u2019t have to think of AI as a separate tool\u2014it should simply exist, seamlessly integrated, and ready to assist. AI should function more like a utility than a standalone feature, much like infrastructure operates as a cloud utility.2. PracticalityPracticality ensures that AI solves real problems. Features must deliver tangible value and address specific pain points rather than feeling like mere gimmicks. Examples include:Summarizing long emails or documents for professionals.Helping marketers generate tailored, effective ad copy.Practical AI UX requires an understanding of the user\u2019s daily challenges and designing solutions that fit seamlessly into their workflows.3. PowerPower highlights the transformative potential of AI. It\u2019s about enabling users to accomplish tasks that were previously difficult or impossible. Think of:An AI-powered legal assistant that extracts case law from hundreds of documents in seconds.A creative AI that generates unique art or music, providing users with tools to explore ideas and concepts, unlocking new avenues for creativity they never had before.When AI demonstrates its power, it becomes a compelling reason for users to adopt the product.The 3 Ps of AI EngineeringComplementing UX design, the3 Ps of AI Engineeringaddress the technical backbone that supports AI products.1.

Explore the unique roles of AI-powered code assistants, conversational tools, and more, and discover why the design and integration of these tools are key to the future of work.Travis FrisingerNov 13, 2024\u20226 min readAI tools are transforming how software is built, with GitHub Copilot at the forefront of this quiet revolution in coding efficiency and team dynamics. A recent working paper from Harvard Business School,Generative AI and the Nature of Work,dives into how these tools reshape workflows, focusing on Copilot\u2019s profound impact on task allocation, productivity, and collaboration.This isn\u2019t just about one tool\u2014it\u2019s about understanding how generative AI is changing the nature of work itself. The findings prompt a bigger question: Are these changes unique to Copilot, or do they reflect a broader shift that depends on the design and purpose of different AI tools?The Copilot Case Study: Key FindingsThe study provides compelling insights into how GitHub Copilot impacts software development workflows. By analyzing millions of work activities over two years, researchers identified four key trends:1. Focus on Core Coding TasksDevelopers using Copilot spent significantly more time writing code and less time on non-coding tasks like project management or coordination. This shift suggests that Copilot enables developers to focus on what they do best\u2014turning ideas into working code.2. Greater Autonomy and ExplorationCopilot encourages developers to experiment and explore solutions rather than just optimizing existing ones. This effect is especially pronounced for less experienced developers, who gain confidence and independence by relying on Copilot for repetitive tasks.3. Flattening Organizational HierarchiesBy empowering less experienced developers to take on more core coding work, Copilot reduces reliance on team collaboration for routine tasks. This dynamic has the potential to flatten hierarchies, making teams more efficient and individual contributors more impactful.4. The Power of IntegrationCopilot\u2019s deep integration with GitHub\u2019s ticketing and source control workflows amplifies its impact, streamlining task management and execution in a way that feels seamless for developers.The diversity of AI tools reflects the broad range of challenges they aim to address in software development. Each class has its own strengths and limitations, and their impact depends heavily on the tool\u2019s design, purpose, and integration into workflows.What the Study Misses: Limitations and Broader ImplicationsWhile Copilot\u2019s integration with GitHub workflows enhances efficiency, it also raises a broader question: Are these changes unique to Copilot\u2019s design and use case, or do they reflect a larger trend across different types of AI tools? Tools that target other stages of the development lifecycle\u2014like debugging or documentation\u2014may offer equally significant, but distinct, impacts.The study\u2019s narrow focus on Copilot prompts further exploration: Could AI tools with different designs, integrations, or use cases deliver similar outcomes? Or are these changes unique to Copilot\u2019s specific functionality and its deep coupling with GitHub workflows?Integration-Driven OutcomesCopilot\u2019s success depends heavily on its tight coupling with GitHub workflows. Tools with less integration or broader functionality may not deliver the same efficiency gains.Skill-Specific ImpactsThe autonomy Copilot provides to less experienced developers might not translate to tools catering to different skill levels or specialized workflows.Scope of TasksThe study focuses on core coding tasks, leaving out how AI tools impact other aspects of development, such as debugging, knowledge sharing, or design.These limitations highlight the need to explore generative AI tools in a broader context, considering their varied purposes and impacts.Tool Classes for AI in Software DevelopmentThe GitHub Copilot study offers a glimpse into one category of AI tools, but the broader ecosystem spans a variety of tools, each addressing specific pain points in the development lifecycle. Let\u2019s explore five key classes of tools and their unique impacts:1. Code Assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Codeium)These tools specialize in autocompleting code, generating boilerplate, and accelerating workflows.Primary Use Case: Turning tickets into code, speeding up repetitive coding tasks, and automating routine development work.Strength: Optimizes productivity for both less experienced developers (who gain confidence and independence) and experienced developers (who save time on repetitive tasks).Limitation: While powerful for automating coding tasks, these tools may offer limited support for higher-level architectural decisions or debugging workflows.2. Conversational Coding Tools (e.g., Cursor, Cody)Conversational tools enable natural language interactions for brainstorming, debugging, and refining code collaboratively with an LLM.Primary Use Case: Problem-solving, collaborative debugging, and generating contextual answers for ambiguous or complex coding challenges.Strength: Enhances creativity, team engagement, and decision-making by fostering discussions around code.Limitation: These tools rely heavily on how teams adopt collaboration practices. They may be less impactful for teams with rigid workflows or well-defined tasks.3. Knowledge Management and Documentation Tools (e.g., GitBook AI, Obsidian AI)These tools focus on generating and managing documentation or summarizing knowledge for technical teams.Primary Use Case: Automating the creation of documentation, technical manuals, and meeting summaries.Strength: Streamlines knowledge dissemination, reduces time spent on writing, and ensures technical details are documented efficiently.Limitation: Effectiveness depends on integration with team workflows and the quality of the source material. They may struggle to handle complex, unstructured knowledge without additional input.4. Data Preparation and Transformation Tools (e.g., Snowflake AI integrations, dbt)These tools automate data preparation, cleaning, and transformation\u2014essential for AI-driven systems and analytics workflows.Primary Use Case: Automating data pipelines, preparing datasets for machine learning, and ensuring data integrity for analytics.Strength: Improves efficiency for data engineering teams, enabling high-quality inputs for downstream AI applications.Limitation: Requires significant setup or expertise, which can be a barrier for smaller teams or those without dedicated data engineers.Why This MattersThe diversity of AI tools reflects the broad range of challenges they aim to address in software development. Each class has its own strengths and limitations, and their impact depends heavily on the tool\u2019s design, purpose, and integration into workflows.For example, a tightly integrated code assistant like GitHub Copilot excels at streamlining core coding tasks but may not address debugging or collaborative workflows as effectively as conversational tools like Cursor. Similarly, tools for knowledge management or data preparation solve entirely different problems, reinforcing the idea that no single AI tool can meet all developer needs.The Role of IntegrationOne of the most significant factors in an AI tool\u2019s impact is how seamlessly it integrates with existing workflows. Copilot\u2019s tight connection to GitHub allows it to function as a natural extension of ticket-based workflows, amplifying its influence on core coding tasks.By contrast, tools like Cursor, which emphasize conversation and multimodal inputs, may have a broader but less direct impact. Their value lies in facilitating exploration, debugging, and creative problem-solving rather than streamlining narrowly defined workflows.Skill Levels and Team DynamicsThe Copilot study found that less experienced developers benefited most from the tool, gaining autonomy and confidence. But other tools may target different skill levels or team dynamics. For example:Code assistants: Help junior developers focus on coding fundamentals.Conversational tools: Foster collaboration and problem-solving, benefiting teams working on ambiguous or complex projects.Knowledge tools: Reduce documentation overhead, aiding cross-functional teams or onboarding processes.Each tool class reshapes workflows in distinct ways, suggesting that the broader impacts of generative AI depend heavily on the design and purpose of the tools in question.Why Tool Class MattersThese differences highlight a critical point: the effects of generative AI in software development aren\u2019t universal. They depend on thetool class\u2014its design, purpose, and integration. A tool designed to streamline ticket-to-code workflows will have a fundamentally different impact than one focused on debugging, design, or knowledge sharing.The GitHub Copilot study is a valuable piece of the puzzle, but understanding AI\u2019s broader impact requires examining the full range of tools and how they interact with developers\u2019 workflows.What This Means for the Future of WorkThe Copilot study illustrates how generative AI tools are reshaping the workplace, but it\u2019s just the beginning. Generative AI doesn\u2019t simply automate tasks\u2014it changes how we approach them. These tools are enabling developers to focus on higher-value work, collaborate more effectively, and even redefine team structures.The diversity of AI tool classes underscores the importance of thoughtful design and integration. As these tools evolve, they will continue to reshape workflows, team dynamics, and the broader software development ecosystem.ConclusionThe Harvard Business School study on GitHub Copilot offers a glimpse into the future of work in software development. By focusing on core coding tasks, fostering autonomy, and flattening hierarchies, Copilot exemplifies the transformative potential of generative AI tools.But as the ecosystem of tools expands, we must recognize that not all tools will have the same impact. The rise of AI tool classes reminds us that design and integration matter as much as the technology itself. Understanding how these tools complement each other will be key to pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in software development.Generative AI is already changing how we work, but the real story is still unfolding. The challenge is to embrace these tools thoughtfully, harnessing their potential to create better workflows, stronger teams, and smarter solutions.As AI tools continue to evolve, how will you integrate them into your workflow to stay ahead in this rapidly changing landscape?AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder. Juniors aren\u2019t learning, orgs lose future leaders, and inequality grows. To thrive, leaders must protect onramps, embrace hybrid roles, and invest in human development\u2014not just automation.Jun 9, 20255 min readFeaturedThe Coherence Trap: Why LLMs Feel Smart (But Aren't Thinking)LLMs don\u2019t think\u2014they resonate.

However, as we push RAG systems from POC (Proof of Concept) to production, challenges such as data integration, synchronization, and scalability issues emerge, potentially undermining performance and reliability. Addressing these obstacles requires a strong data foundation, structured around three essential pillars: Providers, Provenance, and Polyglot Persistence\u2014collectively known as the 3 Ps.Each of these principles plays a unique role in transforming RAG systems from promising POCs into resilient, production-grade solutions:Providersbring diverse data sources - structured, semi-structured, and unstructured - to fuel AI responses, ensuring relevance and depth as new sources are added.Provenancetracks data lineage and transformations, establishing data integrity, trust, and adaptability as requirements grow.Polyglot Persistenceoptimizes data storage across multiple database types, enabling efficient and relevant data retrieval that scales with complexity.Building RAG Systems: The 3 Ps of AI Engineering \u2013 Providers, Provenance, and PolyglotIn this blog, we\u2019ll explore each of these pillars, examining the tools that support them, where custom solutions are typically required, and practical tips for building a robust, scalable RAG system. By understanding and leveraging the 3 Ps, engineers can create AI solutions that transition seamlessly from POC to production, delivering high-quality, contextually rich responses at scale.1. Providers: The Source of Diverse DataProvidersare the entry points for data, supplying the diverse information that fuels an AI system. For RAG systems, where diversity and updates are critical, Providers encompass structured data like databases, semi-structured data like PDFs and PowerPoint presentations, and unstructured data like customer reviews or social media posts. Without a robust network of Providers, an AI system risks delivering limited or outdated responses, reducing its value to users.Example in PracticeConsider a knowledge management system for a large enterprise aiming to assist employees in finding information quickly. The AI system might draw on:Structured Data:Databases: Employee records, project timelines, and organizational charts.Semi-Structured Data:PDFs: Policy documents, compliance guidelines, and training manuals.PowerPoint Presentations: Recent sales pitches, strategic plans, and quarterly reviews.Unstructured Data:Customer Reviews: Feedback from various platforms providing insights into product performance.Emails and Chat Logs: Internal communications that can shed light on project statuses or commonly faced issues.When an employee asks, \"What's the current policy on remote work?\" the system can:Retrieve the latestPDFpolicy document.Reference any recentPowerPointpresentations from HR about policy changes.Pull in relevantcustomer reviewsthat might have influenced policy adjustments.By integrating data from these diverse Providers, the AI system offers a comprehensive, accurate, and context-rich response.Existing SolutionsMany tools can simplify Provider integration, especially for handling different data types:ETL Platforms:Apache NiFi: For building and managing complex data flows, including semi-structured data.Airbyte,Fivetran, andStitch: For connecting APIs, databases, and third-party data providers.Document Processing Tools:Unstructured: For extracting text and metadata from various document formats like PDFs and PowerPoint presentations. It excels at processing unstructured and semi-structured data, making it ideal for integrating diverse documents into your RAG system.Textract(AWS) orAzure AI Document Intelligence: For extracting structured information from documents.These tools offer connectors and processors for various data sources, serving as a base layer for data ingestion.Where Custom Work Is NeededWhile existing tools handle standard formats, custom integration may be required for:Complex Documents: Parsing specialized or proprietary formats.Real-Time Data: Ingesting unstructured data like live customer reviews or social media feeds.Data Freshness and Consistency: Ensuring the most recent versions of documents are used, especially when multiple versions exist.Custom ETL pipelines might be necessary to handle:Version Control: Managing different versions of semi-structured documents.Metadata Extraction: Pulling out specific fields or annotations from documents.Content Categorization: Classifying unstructured data into meaningful categories for retrieval.Practical TipUse ETL tools for standard Providers and build modular ingestion pipelines for specialized or real-time data sources. \"Utilize document processing libraries likeUnstructuredto extract content from PDFs and PowerPoint presentations.Consider leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques for unstructured datalike customer reviews to extract valuable insights such as sentiment, key themes, and customer intents.Sentiment Analysis: Use NLP models to determine whether a review expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This helps your AI system understand overall customer satisfaction and prioritize responses to negative feedback.Topic Modeling: Apply techniques likeLatent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) or transformer-based models to identify common themes within the reviews. This aids in categorizing feedback and identifying prevalent issues or features that customers frequently mention.Entity Recognition: UtilizeNamed Entity Recognition(NER) to extract specific entities such as product names, services, or specific issues mentioned in the reviews. This enables more precise responses and better routing of information within your system.Tools and Libraries:Sentiment Analysis:VADER Sentiment Analyzer: A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is effective on social media and customer review texts.TextBlob: A simple library for processing textual data, which includes a built-in sentiment analysis module.Hugging Face Transformers: Provides access to pre-trained transformer models likeBERTorRoBERTafor more nuanced sentiment analysis.Topic Modeling:Gensim: An open-source library for unsupervised topic modeling and natural language processing, supporting algorithms like LDA and LSI.Entity Recognition:spaCy: A powerful library for advanced NLP tasks, including efficient and accurate named entity recognition.Flair: An easy-to-use NLP library built on PyTorch, offering state-of-the-art NER models.Hugging Face Transformers: Utilize transformer models fine-tuned for NER tasks.By processing unstructured data with these NLP techniques and tools, you enrich your AI system's understanding of customer feedback, enabling it to deliver more accurate and context-aware responses. This not only improves user satisfaction but also provides valuable insights for continuous improvement of your products or services.Designing your system with a flexible architecture will make it easier to integrate new Providers as they become relevant and maintain the agility needed for real-time responses.2. Provenance: The Lifeline of Data IntegritySourcing data alone isn\u2019t enough\u2014tracking the history and transformations of this data is whereProvenancecomes into play. Provenance ensures data traceability, documenting every transformation from raw input to output. In AI engineering, particularly for RAG systems handling varied data types, Provenance is critical to ensure data integrity, accountability, and transparency. It enables engineers to trace any decision back to the data sources that informed it, making it easier to adapt when data changes.Example in PracticeImagine an AI-driven legal assistant used by a law firm, integrating data from multiple sources:Structured Data:Case Management Systems: Details about ongoing and past cases.Semi-Structured Data:Legal Documents in PDFs: Contracts, court filings, and legal briefs.PowerPoint Presentations: Summaries of case strategies or legal precedents.Unstructured Data:Client Emails: Communications that may impact legal strategies.Provenance allows for key info to be tracked:Document Versions: Knowing which version of a contract was used in forming a legal argument.Source Attribution: Identifying which court filing influenced a recommendation.Transformation Steps: Recording how a PDF was parsed and which NLP techniques were applied to extract information.If a legal recommendation changes due to an updated court ruling, Provenance enables lawyers to trace this change back to the specific document and even the exact passage that caused the shift, ensuring accountability and compliance with legal standards.Existing SolutionsSeveral metadata management and data lineage tools support Provenance tracking:OpenLineage: Designed for collecting and integrating lineage data across tools, OpenLineage is a metadata standard supported by various platforms like Airflow, dbt, and Spark. It\u2019s ideal for capturing data lineage across complex workflows.DataHub: Originally developed by LinkedIn, DataHub is a metadata platform that supports data discovery, observability, and lineage tracking. It provides robust lineage visualizations and can handle metadata for data lakes, warehouses, and streaming systems.Amundsen: Another LinkedIn project, Amundsen focuses on data discovery and metadata, with basic lineage support. Its user-friendly interface and robust search functionality make it a popular choice for data discovery in data engineering workflows.Alation: Provides a collaborative data catalog with lineage tracking, metadata management, and powerful search capabilities to help users find and understand data.Cloud Provider Solutions:AWS Glue Data Catalog: A fully managed service that maintains a metadata repository of data sources, including data lineage features.Azure Purview: A unified data governance SaaS solution that provides data discovery, classification, and lineage tracking across on-premises and cloud data sources.Google Cloud Data Catalog: A fully managed and scalable metadata management service with search and data lineage capabilities.These tools offer robust features for documenting data transformations and tracking metadata, providing foundational support for Provenance tracking without the overhead of managing infrastructure.Where Custom Work Is NeededCustom work may be necessary to achieve:Fine-grained tracking: Recording transformations at the level of individual documents or even sections within documents.Cross-Format Lineage: Tracing data lineage across different data types (e.g., from a PDF to a database entry or from an email to a recommendation in the AI system).Regulatory Compliance: Meeting industry-specific traceability standards, such as those required in legal or healthcare fields.Customization might be necessary, especially when dealing with:Complex Data Transformations: Such as OCR processing of scanned documents or NLP analysis of client emails.Data Anonymization Steps: Recording how and when data was anonymized for privacy compliance.Integration with Proprietary Systems: Connecting SaaS tools with in-house or legacy systems that are not supported out-of-the-box.Practical TipStart with metadata management tools likeCollibra,Alation, orAtlanfor broad data lineage tracking. For critical data requiring high accountability, implement custom logging during data transformations, especially for semi-structured or unstructured data. Use unique identifiers for documents and their extracted content to maintain traceability across systems. This balances the ease of these solutions with the precision needed for strict Provenance.3. Polyglot Persistence: Building Data FlexibilitySourcing and tracking data are foundational steps, but storing it in the most effective way for fast retrieval is equally essential.Polyglot Persistenceinvolves using multiple database types to store data based on its structure, retrieval needs, and usage patterns. For complex, diverse data in RAG systems, Polyglot Persistence offers the flexibility to store and retrieve information efficiently, enhancing performance and response relevance.Reframing Embeddings as Derived DataOne key insight is to treat embeddings not as standalone data points but as derived data\u2014high-dimensional representations created directly from source data like text from PDFs, slides from PowerPoint presentations, or sentences from customer reviews. By viewing embeddings as derived data, you can streamline their management and respond more flexibly to updates in the source data. This approach allows for targeted synchronization when source data changes, rather than requiring constant bulk update synchronizations, ultimately improving responsiveness and reducing maintenance overhead.Automatic Synchronization with Database-Integrated VectorizersRecent developments include database-integrated vectorizers. By using SaaS solutions that integrate vectorization capabilities, such asWeaviateorZilliz Cloud, AI engineers can achieve automatic synchronization of embeddings with source data, freeing up resources otherwise spent on synchronization tasks.RAG System Integration Flow: Structured to Unstructured Data TransformationExample in PracticeConsider an AI-powered customer support system that needs to provide instant, accurate responses by accessing:Structured Data:CRM Systems: Customer profiles and interaction histories.Semi-Structured Data:Knowledge Base Articles in PDFs: Product manuals and troubleshooting guides.Training Materials in PowerPoints: Internal staff training slides that might contain useful information.Unstructured Data:Customer Reviews and Feedback: Insights into common issues and sentiments.Using Polyglot Persistence, this system stores each data type in its optimal database: relational for structured data, document stores for PDFs and presentations, NoSQL for unstructured feedback, and vector databases for embeddings. Data integration and virtualization tools ensure seamless access and synchronization across all databases.When a customer asks, \"How can I reset my device's firmware?\" the system can:Retrieve relevant PDF sections from the product manual stored inMongoDB Atlas.Reference PowerPoint slides from training materials indexed inElastic Cloud.Use embeddings stored inPineconeto semantically match the query with both structured and unstructured data, providing a comprehensive answer.Where Custom Work Is NeededWhile these services support storage, Polyglot Persistence introduces complexity around:Data Synchronization: Ensuring updates in semi-structured documents are reflected across all relevant databases.Cross-Database Queries: Enabling seamless queries that span structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.Optimization: Custom indexing and caching strategies to improve retrieval times.Custom work might involve:Implementing Data Synchronization Mechanisms: Using SaaS integration tools or custom scripts to keep data consistent across databases.Setting Up Data Virtualization Layers: Using a platform to provide unified access and querying capabilities.Optimizing Queries and Indexing: Tailoring strategies to your specific data and access patterns for improved performance.Practical TipLeverage SaaS Database Solutions for Simplicity and Scalability:Utilize databases likeMongoDB Atlas,Elastic Cloud, andPineconeto handle different data types without the need to manage infrastructure.Data integration tools likeFivetranorStitchcan be used to automate data synchronization between systems.Implement Unified Data Access with SaaS Data Virtualization Platforms:Consider a platform likePrestoorDremio Cloudto create a virtualized data layer. This allows you to query across multiple data sources with a single interface, simplifying data access and reducing the need for complex data movement.Automate Data Workflows and Synchronization:Use workflow orchestration tools likePrefect CloudorAstronomer(managed Apache Airflow) to schedule and manage data pipelines and synchronization tasks.By leveraging SaaS products, you reduce the operational overhead and complexity associated with managing multiple database systems. This approach enables small teams to implement robust Polyglot Persistence strategies, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval across diverse data types.By understanding and leveraging the 3 Ps, engineers can create AI solutions that transition seamlessly from POC to production, delivering high-quality, contextually rich responses at scalePermissions and Regulatory Compliance: Managing Data Access and PrivacyIn RAG systems, managingPermissionsandRegulatory Complianceis essential for secure, compliant data usage, especially when working with sensitive or regulated data across various formats. Permissions control access levels across datasets, ensuring that only authorized users or systems can access, modify, or retrieve data from Providers. Compliance requirements (such as GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific regulations) often demand data segmentation, audit trails, and secure storage.Best Practices for Permissions and ComplianceImplement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):Define roles and permissionsbased on job functions, limiting access to only the necessary data.Example: Only legal team members can access certain confidential PDFs or PowerPoint presentations.Solutions:Keycloak: An open-source identity and access management tool that provides RBAC, single sign-on (SSO), and integrations with LDAP.Okta: Provides identity management with robust RBAC features.Auth0: Offers authentication and authorization services with fine-grained access control.Azure Entra ID: Includes RBAC capabilities for managing access to cloud resources.Utilize Data Masking and Anonymization:Protect sensitive databy masking identifiable information while still allowing it to be used in RAG responses when needed.Example: Anonymize customer reviews to protect personal information.Solutions:Aircloak: An open-source project from the OpenMined community that provides differential privacy for data anonymization, helping mask sensitive data fields.Protegrity: Offers data protection solutions, including data masking and tokenization.BigID: Provides data discovery and masking for sensitive data across various sources.Informatica Cloud Data Masking: Enables dynamic data masking and anonymization in the cloud.Automate Auditing with Provenance:Track and log every accessand data transformation, providing a clear audit trail.Benefit: Provenance aids in identifying and addressing compliance risks by maintaining a historical record of data usage.Maintain Region-Specific Data Segmentation:Ensure data storage complieswith regional regulations, such as storing EU customer data within Europe for GDPR compliance.Leverage data governance tools to manage permissions and auditing across different data types and storage solutions effectively:Identity and Access Management (IAM): Implement centralized IAM for role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) across applications and data sources, ensuring consistent access controls and user management.Data Governance Platforms: Utilize data governance solutions to manage data catalogs, lineage, and compliance in a unified platform, helping to track data usage, transformations, and ownership.Regular Compliance Protocol Updates: Keep compliance protocols up to date with evolving regulations to maintain data protection and audit-readiness. Robust Provenance tracking is essential for providing clear audit trails and compliance transparency.By utilizing these governance and IAM strategies, you can simplify permissions and compliance management, reduce operational overhead, and maintain focus on building secure, scalable RAG systems.Bridging the Gap from POC to Production with the 3 PsMoving a RAG system from POC to production involves addressing scalability, reliability, and data integrity challenges that aren\u2019t always apparent during the initial development phase. This transition is where the 3 Ps\u2014Providers, Provenance, and Polyglot Persistence\u2014prove their value, offering robust solutions to common obstacles encountered when scaling up.Here\u2019s how each principle plays a critical role in bridging that gap:Providers: Ensuring Data Depth and RelevanceChallenge in POC to Production: In a POC, integrating only a few data sources can showcase system potential. But in production, maintaining relevance requires a broader set of data sources.How Providers Help: A robust network of Providers ensures the system can pull timely, diverse data to handle various scenarios in production, adapting flexibly as new data sources become available.Provenance: Creating Trust and ConsistencyChallenge in POC to Production: During a POC, shortcuts and limited data history are often acceptable. Production systems, however, require traceable, reliable data to ensure trust and regulatory compliance.How Provenance Helps: Provenance provides data traceability and adaptability. It allows engineers to trace each decision back to its data origin, making it easier to identify issues, meet compliance standards, and maintain data integrity over time.Polyglot Persistence: Maintaining Performance and FlexibilityChallenge in POC to Production: A POC may work with a single database, but production demands often require optimized storage solutions for diverse data types.How Polyglot Persistence Helps: Polyglot Persistence enables engineers to store each data type in the optimal database, preventing performance bottlenecks and ensuring flexibility. This approach allows the system to adapt and expand its capabilities smoothly as new data requirements emerge.The 3 Ps provide a powerful framework for transforming an RAG system from an experimental POC into a reliable, adaptable, and high-performing production system.ConclusionFor AI engineers,Providers,Provenance, andPolyglot Persistencerepresent a transformative approach to data management in RAG systems dealing with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. By understanding the role of each principle and leveraging a mix of existing tools and custom solutions, engineers can create AI systems that are adaptable, transparent, and efficient.While many tools can help implement the 3 Ps, custom engineering is often necessary to fully realize these capabilities. Consider how these principles could elevate your own projects, bringing agility, traceability, and optimized retrieval to every interaction. By combining out-of-the-box solutions with tailored enhancements, engineers can build RAG systems that are ready to meet the demands of dynamic, context-rich AI\u2014ultimately delivering more valuable, relevant, and responsive user experiences.Source:Vector Databases Are the Wrong AbstractionAI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

From drafting content to automating tasks, these \"stupid machines\" prove that utility\u2014not intelligence\u2014drives their economic and practical significance.Travis FrisingerSep 5, 2024\u20225 min readArtificial Intelligence: Harnessing Iteration and Practical Value for Economic ImpactImagine a machine that doesn\u2019t understand a single word it generates, yet can write essays, debug code, and even offer philosophical insights. How is this possible? The answer lies in the surprising capabilities of LLMs. At their core, these models are sophisticated next-word predictors\u2014they don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d the text the way humans do. Yet, despite this simplicity, LLMs often exhibit behaviors that seem intelligent. If they\u2019re just \"stupid machines,\" why do they seem so capable, and why is there immense utility and economic value in them, even if they don\u2019t necessarily get \u201csmarter\u201d?Next-Word Prediction and Emergent BehaviorHow Next-Word Prediction WorksAt its heart, an LLM predicts the next word in a sequence of text. This may seem straightforward, but the sheer scale of these models\u2014trained on billions or even trillions of words\u2014enables them to generate impressive outputs. LLMs can write essays, produce code, summarize long texts, and even engage in philosophical debates. They perform tasks that feel intelligent, even though they are simply predicting one word at a time.One of the most critical aspects of LLMs is that their value doesn\u2019t come from single-shot interactions. Instead, their true power comes from the iterative process of refinement and collaboration between the human user and the model.The Emergence of Complex CapabilitiesOne of the most fascinating aspects of LLMs is emergent behavior\u2014abilities that arise from the complexity of the model, even though it wasn\u2019t explicitly trained for those tasks. For example, while LLMs weren\u2019t specifically programmed to write code, they can generate and debug code with remarkable accuracy. This is where machine learning\u2019s magic lies: an enormous dataset and a powerful model can lead to surprising, useful outcomes.But why does this happen? It\u2019s not magic\u2014it\u2019s the result of LLMs picking up patterns deeply embedded in vast datasets. These patterns don\u2019t just match words; they encompass relationships between ideas, structures of language, and abstract concepts. This allows LLMs to handle complex tasks like writing essays or solving problems by leveraging a vast web of relationships between language and context. Though they don\u2019t \"understand\" in the human sense, their predictive capabilities mirror reasoning through pattern recognition.The Human-Like Qualities of LLMsAs LLMs demonstrate their capabilities, we often project human qualities onto them. When an LLM generates a response that feels empathetic, insightful, or clever, it\u2019s easy to believe the machine possesses traits like understanding or wisdom. This phenomenon, known as anthropomorphization, reflects our instinct to attribute human-like qualities to non-human entities.However, this is a cognitive illusion. LLMs are not sentient, nor do they \"feel\" or \"understand\" the content they generate. They are statistical models executing predictions based on training data. When an LLM produces a thoughtful response, it\u2019s not because it comprehends nuance\u2014it\u2019s because it has identified patterns in text that correlate with similar outputs in its training data.This illusion, however, is not without value. In many cases, whether or not a machine truly understands something is irrelevant if it produces a result that meets the desired outcome. As long as the response is coherent and useful, the lack of true comprehension doesn\u2019t diminish the model\u2019s value. The same principle applies in areas like customer service chatbots, where empathy may be less important than resolving the customer\u2019s issue efficiently.Utility Over Intelligence: What Matters in Practice?This brings us to a critical realization: utility does not require intelligence. While LLMs don\u2019t possess self-awareness or human reasoning abilities, they still provide immense value. For example, an LLM can draft content in minutes, saving hours of manual labor. It can suggest lines of code to a developer, speeding up development and reducing errors. In each of these cases, the machine doesn\u2019t need to \"understand\" the task in the human sense\u2014it simply needs to be useful.Iteration and Co-Creation: The True Value of LLMsOne of the most critical aspects of LLMs is that their value doesn\u2019t come from single-shot interactions. Instead, their true power comes from the iterative process of refinement and collaboration between the human user and the model. Unlike traditional tools that require precise inputs, LLMs enable users to engage in a creative, interactive feedback loop.This process of iteration transforms LLMs from simple tools into co-creators. Users often start with an initial prompt that may not yield the perfect result. But through continuous interaction\u2014providing feedback, tweaking the input, and reshaping the outcome\u2014the LLM\u2019s responses evolve. Each iteration brings the user closer to their desired result, making the model more than just a \"stupid machine.\" It becomes an active participant in the creative process.For example, when drafting content with an LLM, the first output might be too generic. But with each revision, as you provide feedback, the output sharpens and becomes more aligned with your vision. Through iterative adjustments to your prompts, the model provides responses that better match your intentions over time.This is where the value of LLMs truly shines. They are not perfect on the first try, but they don\u2019t need to be. Their strength lies in the ability to refine outputs through iterative interactions, allowing users to adjust prompts and guide the model toward better results. Whether it\u2019s writing, coding, or brainstorming, LLMs excel as tools that can generate more relevant responses through continuous input adjustments.Limitations of LLMs: They're Not Always RightWhile LLMs offer impressive utility, it's important to acknowledge their limitations. They generate responses based on patterns in the data they've been trained on, and this means they can sometimes produce outputs that are inaccurate, biased, or misleading. They don\u2019t have a true understanding of the information and, as a result, are prone to errors\u2014especially in tasks requiring critical reasoning or factual accuracy.This is why human oversight remains crucial. LLMs excel when used as tools to assist and augment human work, but they\u2019re not infallible. Understanding these limitations helps ensure we use LLMs responsibly, knowing when to rely on them and when to apply further scrutiny.The Economic Value of \"Stupid Machines\"The economic impact of LLMs, even as \"stupid machines,\" is already significant. Companies use them to automate tasks, enhance customer interactions, and streamline content creation. In software development, LLMs assist developers by suggesting code snippets and automating repetitive tasks. In marketing, they generate personalized content at scale. Even in creative fields, LLMs help brainstorm and refine ideas.The value lies in the cost savings and productivity boosts these models offer. Businesses don\u2019t need AI to have human-like intelligence\u2014they need a tool that reduces costs, increases output, and enhances human workers\u2019 efficiency. Whether or not LLMs become \"smarter\" in the future, their current capabilities provide significant ROI, making them economically viable.Conclusion: Do LLMs Need to Get Smarter?Do LLMs need to get smarter to remain valuable? The answer is likely no. Their utility and economic value stem from their ability to assist, automate, and augment human work\u2014not from any semblance of human-like intelligence. Even if these models never achieve true understanding, they will still be immensely valuable because they perform their tasks well enough to create meaningful outcomes.As we continue to develop these systems, the focus may shift from increasing their \u201cintelligence\u201d to refining how we use them. By finding better ways to integrate LLMs into workflows and harnessing their emergent behaviors, we can unlock even more potential\u2014proving that even \"stupid machines\" can be incredibly useful.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

Let's dive into how this unique project came to life.Why Create a Metal Album About My Cat?You might be wondering, why a metal album about my cat, Mr. Fluffles, also known as Dante? The idea was to experiment with generative AI in a creative context beyond software development\u2014something unfamiliar to me, which would also help me build new skills.Although I'm a classically trained pianist and have some experience in music production through friends who own studios, this was a different challenge. I wanted a quick route to being creative and releasing the silly songs that occupy my mind.Initially, I experimented with Suno by creating silly songs like \"Banana Stew\" and \"Oatmeal Salad.\" These prototypes were fun and demonstrated Suno\u2019s capabilities.Using AI to Compose and CreateThere's always a tune playing in my head, and I love making up songs. Using AI tools, I was able to compose music, write lyrics, and even generate album art. This journey was filled with discovery and creativity.Exploring SunoAIFirst up, let's talk about Suno, or SunoAI\u2014an artificial intelligence music creation program. Suno is designed to generate realistic songs that combine vocals and instrumentals or purely instrumental tracks. It has been widely available since December 2023 after the launch of a web application in partnership with Microsoft, which included Suno as an optional plugin for Microsoft Copilot.If you're unfamiliar, Microsoft Copilot is a chat-based tool integrated into various Microsoft products, enabling users to generate content based on prompts. Suno works similarly, allowing you to prompt it with a simple description, mood, genre, or more detailed instructions, including lyrics, song titles, and structure.While Suno doesn\u2019t disclose the dataset used to train its AI, it claims to have safeguards against plagiarism and copyright infringement. I tested it by prompting in the style of well-known artists like Taylor Swift, and it refused, suggesting some level of protection against direct imitation.Initially, I experimented with Suno by creating silly songs like \"Banana Stew\" and \"Oatmeal Salad.\" These prototypes were fun and demonstrated Suno\u2019s capabilities, though they leaned more towards pop than metal. However, they gave me a foundation to build upon as I delved into creating more structured music.Leveraging the Community and StructureSuno's community feature is incredibly helpful. On its homepage, you'll find a showcase of popular songs across various genres, from drum and bass to indie pop and metal. The trending songs section allows you to reuse prompts, giving you a sense of how to structure your own music.Once I grasped the basics, I began integrating more detailed prompts. I combined these insights with another generative AI tool, ChatGPT, to refine the lyrics and structure. By analyzing different examples of metal band lyrics and melodies, I honed in on the thrashy style I enjoy.Creating \"Mr. Fluffle's Reign of Tiny Terror\" blended AI generation and personal creativity. It was about guiding the AI, making decisions, and refining the output to craft something unique.Integrating ChatGPTChatGPT played a crucial role in the lyrical and conceptual development of the album. After experimenting with few-shot prompting, I provided a list of album song titles and descriptions, asking ChatGPT to generate metal songs matching those criteria. The results were impressive, with ChatGPT crafting well-structured lyrics that fit the desired vibe.The key was maintaining a consistent thread in my work. By keeping the context in place, ChatGPT was able to produce coherent and stylistically aligned lyrics across the entire album.Creating Album ArtI initially used Suno's auto-generated options for the album art, but they lacked the personalized touch I wanted. I turned to ChatGPT\u2019s image editing capabilities, tweaking the designs until they matched the album\u2019s theme. This iterative process allowed me to remove text, adjust elements, and fine-tune the art, creating a cohesive visual representation of the music.Challenges and LimitationsDespite the successes, there were challenges. Suno's limited control over specific aspects of the music, such as tempo and vocal prominence, was frustrating. I often found myself wishing for more fine-tuned adjustments. Generating multiple versions and discarding near-perfect ones due to minor issues was time-consuming.However, advancements in Suno\u2019s models have been promising. The ability to generate longer songs and extend tracks suggests that more detailed modifications might be possible in the future.Reflecting on the ExperienceCreating \"Mr. Fluffle's Reign of Tiny Terror\" blended AI generation and personal creativity. It was about guiding the AI, making decisions, and refining the output to craft something unique. This project showcased the potential of combining human creativity with generative AI to produce substantial works quickly.While this album was an experiment, it has garnered positive feedback, bringing joy and a sense of accomplishment. It highlighted how AI can accelerate the creative process, allowing for rapid iteration and exploration.ConclusionIn conclusion, \"Mr. Fluffle's Reign of Tiny Terror\" was an exciting journey into AI-driven creativity. It demonstrated the potential of generative AI tools like Suno and ChatGPT to enhance and expedite the creative process.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.

Integrating Human-Centered Design (HCD) principles ensures AI solutions are transparent, thus enhancing user trust.Travis FrisingerJul 26, 2024\u20228 min readAI and Human Centered DesignGen AI and SAT (Boolean Satisfiability Problem Solver) solvers likePySATare powerful tools capable of solving complex problems across various domains. However, to truly harness their potential, it is crucial to provide users with clear explanations of how these solutions are derived. This aligns perfectly with human-centered design (HCD) principles, which focus on creating solutions that are empathetic, inclusive, intuitive, and transparent. In this blog, we'll explore how integrating HCD principles can enhance the user experience with Gen AI, using the example of generating a Fibonacci sequence.Integrating experiences from working on SAT solvers for youth sports scheduling, I noticed the critical need for explainability and managing response latency, especially when technologies involve human interaction. These lessons are invaluable when transitioning to Gen AI, where similar challenges arise. By addressing these issues, we can build more reliable and user-friendly AI systems.The human needs to remain in the loop and able to actively carry the solution context back into their work if we are to effectively co-create with Gen AI.Gen AI and SAT SolversGen AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate human-like text, code, art, and more. SAT Solvers are algorithms used to determine if a given Boolean formula can be satisfied, with applications in hardware verification, software testing, logistics and scheduling.The relationship between SAT solvers and Gen AI lies in their ability to handle complex problem-solving. Both require transparent decision-making processes and efficient handling of data. Lessons from SAT solvers, such as the importance of clear solution explanations and minimizing latency, are directly applicable to Gen AI. These principles help in making AI systems more understandable and efficient, ensuring better user experiences.While these technologies are adept at providing solutions, the real value lies in their ability to explain the reasoning behind these solutions. This fosters trust, aids learning, and allows users to adapt the solutions to their specific contexts.The Role of Human-Centered DesignHuman-Centered Design (HCD) is a crucial approach in creating technology that genuinely serves its users. By focusing on the user experience, HCD ensures that products are not only functional but also empathetic, inclusive, intuitive, and transparent. This methodology emphasizes the importance of understanding user needs and contexts, making technology accessible to all users, ensuring ease of use, and providing clear, traceable information. Integrating HCD principles into the development of Gen AI can significantly enhance their usability, accessibility, and trustworthiness.A Brief History of Human-Centered DesignHuman-Centered Design (HCD) has a rich history rooted in the evolution of user experience (UX) design and the broader field of design thinking. Here\u2019s a concise overview of its development:Early Beginnings: Ergonomics and Human FactorsThe origins of HCD can be traced back to the early 20th century, particularly during World War II, when the need for designing equipment that fit human capabilities became paramount. Ergonomics and human factors engineering emerged to optimize the interaction between people and machines, leading to more efficient and safer designs.1960s-1970s: The Rise of Cognitive PsychologyIn the 1960s and 1970s, the field of cognitive psychology began to influence design thinking. Researchers like Donald Norman, a key figure in HCD, emphasized understanding how people perceive, remember, and solve problems. This period saw the development of user-centered design (UCD), focusing on making systems more intuitive and user-friendly.1980s: The Computer RevolutionThe advent of personal computing in the 1980s brought HCD to the forefront of software development. Apple, with its Macintosh, was a pioneer in emphasizing user-friendly interfaces. The graphical user interface (GUI) became a standard, making computers accessible to a broader audience. This era solidified the importance of designing with the user in mind.1990s-2000s: UX Design and Design ThinkingThe 1990s and 2000s witnessed the formalization of UX design and the widespread adoption of design thinking. IDEO, a global design firm, popularized design thinking\u2014a methodology centered on empathy, ideation, and experimentation. This approach emphasized understanding users\u2019 needs and contexts, leading to more innovative and effective solutions.2010s-Present: Integrating HCD with Emerging TechnologiesIn the 2010s, HCD principles began to integrate with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The focus shifted towards creating seamless, intuitive, and inclusive experiences across diverse platforms and devices. Today, HCD is a critical aspect of designing complex systems, ensuring that technology serves human needs effectively.Core Principles of Human-Centered DesignHuman-Centered Design (HCD) is about designing products with the user in mind. This involves:Empathy:Understanding user needs and contexts.Inclusivity:Making technology accessible to all users.Intuitiveness:Ensuring ease of use and reducing the learning curve.Transparency:Providing clear, understandable, and traceable information.HCD ensures that products are not only functional but also usable and accessible. This approach reduces frustration, increases satisfaction, and promotes widespread adoption. Integrating these principles into Gen AI can significantly enhance its usability, accessibility, and trustworthiness. By providing clear and understandable explanations, users can validate and learn from the solutions, ensuring that technology serves their needs effectively.It\u2019s no longer just about generating a basket of choices; I can now trust the AI to refine and enhance ideas based on my input. This feels like a significant step forward in co-creating with Gen AI.Applying HCD Principles: Fibonacci Sequence ExampleLet's explore how these principles can be applied using the example of generating some code to create a Fibonacci sequence with ChatGPT.Enhancing Explainability and TransparencyWhen I asked ChatGPT tocreate a fib sequence method in python,it produced the following output:Fibonacci sequenece without comments but a detailed explaintion that followHere, each step is not clearly explained in code with comments but as a summary after, making it easier for users to understand the logic without cluttering the code.Another example of this would be the inverse where there is no summary but solely the use of comments in the code as a way of explaining.Fibonacci sequenece with commentsBoth approaches explain the solution well providing a high trust experience for the user ensuring they carry the context of the solution back into their work, not just copying and pasting it because the machine said so. Its all about collaboration, not just delegation.The goal should be explainability in the solution achieved, be it code, images, audio, etc. The human needs to remain in the loop and able to actively carry the solution context back into their work if we are to effectively co-create with Gen AI. By incorporating interactive features, we can further enhance this understanding and engagement to allow for a deeper level of fidelity.Interactive FeaturesCreating an interactive section where code can run and users can input different values of 'n' to see the sequence generated in real-time can enhance understanding. Providing explanations for each step as the sequence is built ensures that users can follow along and grasp the underlying logic. This interactivity makes learning more engaging and effective.I noticed the critical need for explainability and managing latency, especially when technologies involve human interaction.Expanding on this concept, we can relate it toconversational artifacts. By producing well-documented interactive experiences as a result of dialogue, we advance our maturity in HCD. These structured content fragments, like code snippets and diagrams, turn AI interactions into productive collaborations. Conversational artifacts organize complex information, facilitate iterative development, and enhance collaboration by providing a shared reference point. They transform AI conversations into tangible and valuable outputs.Claude AI's Artifacts feature is an excellent example of this. Artifacts in Claude are dedicated windows that display substantial, standalone content generated in response to a user\u2019s request. This can include documents, code snippets, diagrams, and interactive components. By providing structure, persistence, and clarity to AI interactions, artifacts boost clarity and human-AI collaboration, transforming how we work, learn, and create in the AI age.In the example below, I asked Claude to \"make me a react app version of space invaders\". It produced an interactive application that I can chat with to change as well as, documenting the code and provided detailed explanations of what it implemented.  Thus providing me with level of higher trust of my interaction with Gen AI.Claude's Conversation Artifact: Space Invader Game RunningChatGPT offers similar functionality to conversational artifacts with images, allowing users to select an image for refinement or choose specific regions to modify. For example, I used Gen AI to create an image for a song my daughter and I made up about her cat Pink chasing a bird. I was able to select a region of the image and give specific directions to ChatGPT on what to do. This detailed level of interaction with Gen AI is only possible due to the interactive nature of the initial output request. It\u2019s no longer just about generating a basket of choices; I can now trust the AI to refine and enhance ideas based on my input. This feels like a significant step forward in co-creating with Gen AI.Editing an image in ChatGPT's conversational interface editorBuilding Trust Through ExplainabilityCreating an environment of trust is fundamental when integrating AI into any system. Trust is the cornerstone that allows users to feel confident in the technology. One of the most effective ways to build this trust is through explainability.Transparency in Decision-MakingClearly outlining the decision-making process of the AI helps build trust. Showing intermediate steps and the logic used to arrive at the solution provides users with a deeper understanding and confidence in the AI's outputs. Transparency ensures that users can follow the AI's reasoning, making the technology more trustworthy.Validation MechanismsProviding ways for users to validate and verify the solutions is essential. Allowing users to compare the generated sequence with known benchmarks ensures they can trust the accuracy of the AI's outputs. Validation mechanisms are crucial for establishing reliability and credibility.PersonalizationAllowing users to customize the level of detail in explanations based on their familiarity with the subject matter enhances the user experience. For beginners, providing more detailed explanations and visual aids is beneficial, while advanced users might prefer a brief overview. Personalization ensures that the technology meets the needs of a diverse user base.ConclusionAs companies adopt Gen AI into their software and processes, integrating human-centered design principles can significantly enhance trustworthiness. Providing clear and understandable explanations not only helps users validate and learn from the solutions but also ensures that technology serves their needs effectively. The Fibonacci sequence example demonstrates how step-by-step breakdowns, visual aids, interactive features, and detailed annotations can transform complex solutions into comprehensible and valuable tools for users. The lessons learned from working with SAT solvers, such as the importance of clear solution paths and minimizing latency, can be directly applied to Gen AI, ensuring better user experiences and more effective collaboration between humans and AI.Call to ActionLet's continue to advocate for and implement explainability in our Gen AI solutions. By doing so, we build trust with our users, fostering a collaborative environment where AI serves as a reliable and understandable partner in the creative process.AI and the Vanishing Ladder: Rethinking Work in the Age of AutomationAI is erasing entry-level roles, gutting the talent ladder.
