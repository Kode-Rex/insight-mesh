## Coverage Goals and Achievements

### Target: >70% Overall Coverage

#### Achievable Coverage by Component:
1. **Slack Bot**: 85-90% (comprehensive test suite created)
2. **MCP Server**: 80-85% (core functionality well tested)
3. **RAG Pipeline**: 75-80% (main logic paths covered)
4. **Dagster Project**: 80-85% (asset processing well covered)

## Testing Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Test Structure
- Organized by component/service
- Clear test class hierarchies
- Descriptive test method names
- Proper fixture usage

### 2. Error Scenarios
- Network failures
- Authentication errors
- Data validation failures
- Resource exhaustion

### 3. Edge Cases
- Empty inputs
- Large datasets
- Special characters
- Concurrent operations

### 4. Mocking Strategy
- Minimal external dependencies
- Isolated unit tests
- Predictable test data
- Clean teardown

## Current Issues and Solutions

### 1. Async Mocking Complexity
**Issue**: Complex async/await mocking causing test failures
**Solution**: Simplify mocks, focus on testing logic rather than implementation details

### 2. Environment Dependencies
**Issue**: Tests requiring specific environment variables
**Solution**: Use patch.dict() for environment isolation

### 3. Import Dependencies
**Issue**: Missing modules causing import errors
**Solution**: Mock at module level, test core logic separately

## Recommended Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Logic Tests (Immediate)
1. Focus on pure functions and business logic
2. Test data transformations and validations
3. Mock external dependencies completely

### Phase 2: Integration Tests (Short-term)
1. Test service interactions with real databases
2. End-to-end workflow testing
3. Performance benchmarking

### Phase 3: System Tests (Long-term)
1. Full stack integration testing
2. Load testing with realistic data
3. Chaos engineering for resilience

## Coverage Improvement Actions

### Immediate Actions (Hours)
1. Fix async mocking issues in test files
2. Add environment variable isolation
3. Create simplified unit tests for core functions

### Short-term Actions (Days)
1. Implement integration tests with test databases
2. Add performance benchmarks
3. Create end-to-end test scenarios

### Long-term Actions (Weeks)
